<h2><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>A few years ago, Mrs. Carl&eacute;n was comparatively unknown to
readers in this country; but the marked success which followed
the publication of "One Year of Wedlock" encouraged the translator
in the endeavor to present that lady's works to the American
public.</p>

<p>In her writings Mrs. Carl&eacute;n exhibits a versatility which may
be considered remarkable. While in one book she revels in
descriptions of home-scenes and characters, in another she presents
her readers with events and incidents that bear a strong
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>resemblance to the startling and melo-dramatic productions of
many of the modern romance writers of France.</p>

<p>This peculiarity, however, may be accounted for by the fact
that she writes&mdash;as she herself confesses&mdash;entirely from impulse.</p>

<p>When her mind is clouded by sorrow&mdash;and she has been
oppressed with many bitter griefs&mdash;she seeks to remove the cause
of her despondency by creating a hero or heroine, afflicted like
herself, and following this individual through a train of circumstances
which, she imagines, would naturally occur during a life
of continued gloom and sorrow.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when life appears bright and beautiful to
her, then she tells a tale of joy; a story of domestic life, for where
does pure happiness exist except at the fireside at home?</p>

<p>It must have been during one of these bright intervals of her
life that Mrs. Carl&eacute;n wrote "The Home in the Valley," for the
work is a continued description of the delights of home, which,
although occasionally obscured by grief, and in some instances, by
folly, are rendered still more precious by their brief absence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Valley.</span></h3>


<p>In one of father La Fontaine's books, may be found a
description of a lovely valley, the residence of a beautiful
and modest maiden, and of the heroine of this Arcadia he
writes:</p>

<p>"There stands our heroine, as lovely as the valley, her
home, and as virtuous and good as her mother, who has
devoted a lifetime to the education of her daughter."</p>

<p>But with the history of this maiden he weaves the workings
of an evil genius, which in the end is triumphant; for
even the pure are contaminated after they arrive at that
period when they consider that vice has its virtues.</p>

<p><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>Our story is located near the beautiful Lake Wenner, in
a valley which much resembles that described by La Fontaine.
As we enter this valley, the first object that meets
our view is a small red-colored cottage. A vine twines
itself gracefully over one of the windows, the glass panes
of which glisten through the green leaves, which slightly
parted, disclose the sober visage of an ancient black cat,
that is demurely looking forth upon the door yard. She
has chosen a sunny spot on the window sill, for the cheering
beams of the sun are as grateful to a cat, as is the
genial warmth of the stove to an old man, when winter has
resumed his sway upon earth. If we should enter the
cottage, we would in all probability find the proprietor of
the little estate seated in his old arm-chair, while his daughter-in-law&mdash;but
more of this anon.</p>

<p>From the cottage the ground descended in a slight
slope, which terminated in a white sandy beach at the margin
of the lake. Near the beach were fastened the small
skiffs, which swayed to and fro amongst the rushes, where
the children delighted to sail their miniature ships. From
the rear of the house the little valley extended itself in
undulating fields and meadows, interspersed with barren
hillocks and thrifty potato patches. In the fields could be
heard the tinkling of the cow-bells, the bleating of lambs,
and the barking of a dog as he gathered together his little
flock. Carlo was a fortunate dog, for the farm was so
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>small that he could keep his entire charge within sight at
all times.</p>

<p>Near the centre of the valley stood a large tree, the
widely spread branches of which shaded a spring, which
gushed forth from beneath a huge moss-covered stone.
This was the favorite place of resort of a beautiful maiden,
who might be seen almost every summer evening
reclining upon the moss that bordered the verge of the
spring.</p>

<p>"There stands our heroine, as lovely as the valley, her
home, and as virtuous and good as her mother, who has
devoted a lifetime to the education of her daughter."</p>

<p>But many years before the date of our story, Nanna had
lost the protection of her beloved mother; yet the loss
had been partially supplied by her sister-in-law, who occupied
the places of a kind mother, a gentle sister, and a
faithful friend.</p>

<p>Nanna was now in her sixteenth year; but to all appearances
she was much younger. Unlike others of her years,
her cheeks did not display the bloom of maidenhood, and
her countenance lacked the vivacity natural to her age.
Her features wore an expression of melancholy, which
was perfectly in keeping with the pallor of her cheeks, the
pearly whiteness of which vied in brilliancy with the hue
of a lily.</p>

<p>Nanna was the child of poverty, and belonged to that
class of beings, who, situated between riches and nobility
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>on the one hand, and poverty on the other, are considered
as upstarts by the wealthy as well as the poor.</p>

<p>Nanna's father, when young, was placed in an entirely
different position of life than that in which we now find
him. An illegitimate son, he entered the world with a borrowed
title, but with fair prospects for the future; for his
father, a man of consequence and wealth, intended to
marry his mother, and thus the son would bear no longer
the stigma of his father's crime. But death, who in this
case had been forgotten, suddenly cut the thread of his
father's life, and the mother and son were driven forth from
the house of their protector, deprived of honor, wealth,
and station.</p>

<p>This is an old, very old and thread-bare story, and not
more novel is that which generally follows. First comes
melancholy, then great exertions on the part of the injured
party; next dashed hope, and finally gloomy resignation.</p>

<p>The mother died, the son lived to pass through the life
we have above described, but which was ended, however,
by matrimony. He married after he had passed his fortieth
year.</p>

<p>Before his marriage, Carl Lonner passed through the
various gradations in society, from the nobleman to the
simple gentleman. He supported himself by revenues he
derived from a small business, and by drawing up legal
papers for the surrounding peasantry and fishermen. For
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>a wife he had chosen the daughter of a half pay sergeant,
and in this case his fortunate star was in the ascendant,
for she not only brought him a loving heart, but also the
little farm on which he resided at the date of our story.</p>

<p>We will now, however, turn our attentions to Nanna,
who is sitting beneath the tree near the spring, in which
she has been bathing her feet.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As Nanna glanced into the clear water of the spring,
she shuddered convulsively, although the air was warm,
for it was a June evening, but it was a shudder from
within that shook her slight form. Nanna had lately perceived
that her dear sister-in-law, Magde, when she
thought herself unseen, had shed tears, and the poor girl's
heart beat with a sensation of undefined fear, for when
Magde weeps, thought she, there must have been a great
cause.</p>

<p>"Why is the world so formed as it is? Some flowers
are so modest and little that they would be trodden under
foot unless great care is taken, while others elevate their
great and gaudy heads above the grass. The latter are
the rich, while the little down-trodden blossoms are the
poor. And so it is with even the birds! one is greater
than the other, and mankind is not behind them. We belong
to the poor; there," she continued, turning her deep
eyes towards a distant point in the horizon, on the other
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>side of the lake, "there lives the rich; they take no notice
of us. Even the poor fishermen and peasants say, 'Our
children cannot be the play-fellows of Mademoiselle
Nanna.' Mademoiselle, Mademoiselle," she repeated
slowly, "it is shameful to call me so! and how much
better it would be to call Magde good mother, than to
give her the title of My Lady! To be poor is not so bad,
but to be friendless is bitter indeed."</p>

<p>As she thus sat, with her eyes fixed mournfully upon the
distant object which was the roof of an elegant house,
which was barely visible over the brow of a hill, she was
startled by the noise of approaching footsteps. She had
scarcely cast her mantle over her white shoulders, which
she had uncovered during her ablutions, when, to her great
astonishment, she discovered a stranger rapidly approaching
towards her. He was clothed in a light frock coat; a
knapsack was fastened upon his shoulders, and in his hand
he swung a knotted stick. Nanna had never before beheld
a personage who resembled the stranger. His face,
browned in the sun, until it resembled that of a gipsy,
wore an honest and frank expression, and his dark curling
hair, which fell in thick clusters from his black felt hat,
added to the pleasing aspect of his countenance.</p>

<p>Nanna, who at her first glance at the youth, had thought
him a gipsy, which wild tribe she greatly feared, was reassured
by a second look.</p>

<p>The stranger, on his side, appeared greatly astonished at
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>the sudden appearance of the beautiful water nymph, for
such a goddess Nanna much resembled, as she stood, with
her garments flowing gracefully around her slight figure;
her tiny white feet playing with the moist grass, and her
pale and mournful face, encircled with golden locks, that
fell negligently upon her white and well rounded
shoulders.</p>

<p>The youth thus addressed her:</p>

<p>"Pardon me, lovely naiad. It appears that I have
taken the wrong path, although I supposed that I had
chosen the right direction."</p>

<p>"Whither are you going?" inquired Nanna, in a voice
sweet and melodious.</p>

<p>"To Almvik," replied the stranger.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the maid, casting a peculiar glance at his
knapsack, "I hoped that you were not a member of the
aristocracy."</p>

<p>"Oh, my little sylph, for I know not what else to call
you, is my face so poor a recommendation, that I cannot
be considered a man because I carry a pack on my
back?"</p>

<p>"Are those of noble birth the only men?" inquired
Nanna, and a gloomy expression fell upon her lips, which
a moment before had been illumined with a sunny smile.</p>

<p>"Ah," replied the youth, "the longer I gaze upon your
dear face, the more I esteem you. Far be it from me to
wound your sensitive nature. If it will comfort you, I
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>will say that no man can long more earnestly than I do for
the time when all mankind shall be equal."</p>

<p>"Do you speak from your heart?"</p>

<p>"I do, earnestly; but tell me your name."</p>

<p>"Nanna, Nanna of the Valley, I am called."</p>

<p>"That is poetical; but have you no other name?"</p>

<p>"I am sometimes called Mademoiselle Nanna; but that
grieves me, for we are poor people."</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought that you were something more than a
peasant girl. Pardon me, I have spoken too familiarly. I
knew not your station."</p>

<p>"Familiarly!"</p>

<p>"I addressed you too warmly."</p>

<p>"Your words sounded well when you thus spoke."</p>

<p>"Possibly; but henceforth I shall address you as Mademoiselle
Nanna."</p>

<p>"Shall we then see each other again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, quite probably&mdash;we are to be neighbors."</p>

<p>"You intend, then, to reside at Almvik?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for a few weeks, perhaps during the whole summer;
but I pray you come with me a few steps on my
road, I need your guidance."</p>

<p>Nanna sprang to her feet, and as she stood before the
young man, her eyes sparkling with unusual brilliancy, her
garments falling in graceful folds over her sylph-like limbs,
he gazed at her as if enchained by her almost superhuman
beauty. To the youthful stranger's request she answered
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>by putting her little white feet in such active motion,
that they seemed to tread upon the air instead of the
green sward.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Cottage.</span></h3>


<p>The interior of the little building to which we now turn,
was thus arranged: The ground floor was divided into a
kitchen and three other apartments, viz:&mdash;a middle sized
room, by favor called the parlor, in which was generally
the dwelling place of the family, and a small chamber on
either side of the parlor. One of these was the bed-chamber
of Carl Lonner, and the other was occupied by his
eldest son and his wife.</p>

<p>The upper story, that is, the attic, contained two divisions,
and the sole dominion of these airy apartments was
granted to two younger members of the family; the front
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>room belonging to Nanna, and the other to her brother
Carl, known in the neighborhood by the nick-name of
"Wiseacre," and under certain circumstances as "Crazy
Carl," although it would have been difficult to find throughout
the entire neighborhood a personage wiser than honest
Carl.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire building the marks of poverty
were plainly evident; but at the same time each object
presented a tidy and cleanly appearance and although the
cottage lacked many luxuries, still comfort seemed to
reign supreme. The rush covered floor; the table, polished
to brightness; and the flower vases, filled with odorous
boquets of lilacs, the neat window curtains, the handicraft
of Nanna, the crimson sofa curtain, embroidered by the
thrifty Magde, all combined, proved that the inmates of
the cottage, had not only the taste, but also the inclination
to render home pleasant even under the most adverse circumstances.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At the time that Nanna had started forth as a guide
to the youthful stranger, old Mr. Lonner was seated near
the side of his bed in his private apartment. Although
weighed down by age and the grief that had oppressed his
early life, he nevertheless possessed that gentleness and
sociability, which had ever been the characteristic
traits of his life. His flowing white locks fell around his
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>countenance, from which the traces of manly beauty had
not been entirely eradicated, and as he smoked his pipe
with an air of dignified pleasure, he would occasionally
glance towards a young matron, who, seated in a large
arm chair, was reading aloud a letter to him.</p>

<p>The letter bore the postmark of Goteborg, and was written
by the old man's eldest son, Ragnar Lonner, the
husband of the matron. He was mate of a trading vessel,
and three months before had bidden farewell to his wife
and family. As she continued reading the letter, three
children who had been playing, commenced a little dispute
about the proprietorship of a large apple. In an opposite
corner Carl had stationed himself. He was a full grown
youth with a face bearing an expression of mingled silliness
and wisdom.&mdash;As he glanced from under his long hair,
first at the bed-quilt, then at the quarrelling children, he
paid close attention to all that his sister-in-law was reading
aloud. Carl was not the simpleton people considered him,
although his highest ambition appeared to consist in erecting
dirt houses and making mud-pies.</p>

<p>"Magde," said the old man, casting a glance of affection
upon the vivacious Magdalena. "You had better
read that letter again. Ragnar is a son who has his
heart in the right place."</p>

<p>"And a husband too!" added Magde, and a flush of
joyful pride overspread her blooming cheeks.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a brother also; read the letter once more, it
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>will be none the less pleasant to read it a third time when
Nanna returns."</p>

<p>Magde, who had not refolded the letter, commenced
reading again, and her voice trembled with pride and
emotion as she read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Beloved Magde:</p>

<p>"When you shall break the seal of this letter, I feel
assured that you will wish you possessed wings that you
might be enabled to fly to your loving husband. And as
I think I see you approaching me through the air, surrounded
by our little angels,&mdash;may God protect them,&mdash;the
tears start to my eyes, tears which no man should be
ashamed to shed, and I feel an inward desire to hasten to
meet you.</p>

<p>"But now, dear Magde, I must control my thoughts,
and so direct them to you, that they shall prove intelligible.
I arrived, on the eighth day of this month, at Goteborg,
in safety and in good health. I hope our father is
well and capable of enjoying as usual, the balmy air and
bright verdure of summer.</p>

<p>"Our little cottage is a pleasant residence, in spite of all
its disadvantages, and I feel assured that both yourself
and Nanna do all that lies in your power to cheer our
mutual parent, when he is sick and dispirited.</p>

<p>"One night while our vessel was lying in the canal, I was
visited by an evil dream, but dreams are empty and meaningless,
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>and I hope that no more of my disagreeable fancies
will be realized than that you at home, may experience a
little anxiety and solicitude concerning the welfare of the
absent one.</p>

<p>"The Spring of the year is always the most severe season,
for winter consumes the harvest of the preceding
summer.</p>

<p>"Well, we have many mouths to feed&mdash;God protect
our children.&mdash;When they are older they will work for us.
It was my intention to send you a small sum of money in
this letter; but I was obliged to wait until Jon Jonson,
who is here at present with his sloop, shall commence his
homeward voyage, for I can place no dependence upon
young Rask to whom I am obliged to entrust this letter,
as he might be tempted on his way to the post office to
enter a beer-house, and there lose the money. I am forced
to send Rask to the office, as I am obliged to remain on
the vessel until it is unloaded.</p>

<p>"I will tell you in advance that I shall not be able to
send you a large amount of money; but instead of that, I
shall forward you when Jonson returns, a quantity of
foreign goods which I have been fortunate enough to purchase
and to place on board his sloop without paying the
duty, which you know is heavy. It consists of sugar,
coffee, tobacco, cotton yarn, and a package of silks.</p>

<p>"You, my dear wife, must select the best, a silk shawl
which you will find in the package. Nanna may have the
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>next best shawl, and you may give Carl the blue handkerchief
which is at the bottom of the parcel. I have not
forgotten father. I shall send him a small cask of liquor,
and in the parcel of silks you will find a bundle of toys
for the children.</p>

<p>"You cannot imagine&mdash;but still you must&mdash;how pleasant
it is to deprive oneself of luxuries that you may provide
for the wants of those whom you have left at home.</p>

<p>"My ship-mates frequently say that I am severe towards
them when at sea, perhaps I am; but it grieves me when
I see those noble men, so skillful in the management of
our vessel, lavish their money when on shore in foolish
pleasures. They have as great reason to be economical
as I have myself, and I cannot resist from occasionally
censuring them, and therefore I may not appear so kind to
them as I am to you when at home, or while I am writing
this letter. Although all my efforts may be fruitless, still
I feel assured that there is not one man amongst them
who would not peril his existence to rescue 'the tiger,' as
they call me, from any danger. They well know that I
would not stop to think, but would spring into the ocean
at once, if it was necessary, to rescue them.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Magde, a word in confidence. I am
neither as wise or as well educated as my father was in
his younger days, yet I would not wound your feelings
either by word or action; but I must inform you that a
rumor has reached my ears about a certain man, whose
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>neck I once would have twisted willingly, because, when
in church, he looked at you oftener than he did at the
minister.</p>

<p>"But if, when I return, I discover that that villain from
Almvik has been poaching on my grounds, he must look
to safety. In you, Magde, I can place all confidence, and
shall therefore say nothing further. And now farewell.
Remember me firstly to my father, and then to my sister,
and my children.</p></div>

<p class="right15">"Your faithful husband,</p>
<p class="right10 smcap">"Ragnar Lonner.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"P.S. During the soft moonlight nights, when on my
watch, I see your form, dear Magde, bright and beautiful,
as I look over the wake of the vessel. And when the
night is dark and cloudy, I see you sitting by my side, the
binnacle light shining upon your pleasant face, which is
illumined with smiles as I gaze upon little Conrad, whom I
imagine a fine full grown lad, climbing the shrouds with
all the eagerness of a competent sailor. But, belay,
otherwise my letter will be under sail again."</p></div>

<p>When Magde read the portion of her husband's letter
which he had intended as confidential, her voice trembled
as it did when she had first read the letter.</p>

<p>"It would have been my desire," said she, "that Ragnar
had sent the money in the letter. It has been more
than three weeks, dear father, since you have partaken of
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>other food than fish, bread and potatoes. Ah! I wish we
had a quarter of beef!"</p>

<p>"O, stop your prating, child! Fish is very good food
indeed."</p>

<p>"But not strengthening. How delicious it would be if
we only had a partridge, or even a rabbit. Certainly they
would not cost much! But who dare think of such luxuries?
All delicacies must be sent to Almvik."</p>

<p>"God grant that we may have nothing worse to expect
from Almvik, than that they should prevent us from enjoying
luxuries that poor people cannot expect to procure."</p>

<p>"O, that is not my opinion. In winter-time, when Ragnar
is at home, he procures us many a savory dish with
his gun."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I think that if Ragnar has disturbed the
hunting grounds of Almvik, he may consider himself fortunate
if the proprietor has not poached upon his own
premises in return. The affairs of Almvik are far differently
conducted than they were formerly, under the sway
of the ancient proprietor."</p>

<p>During their conversation the old man and Magde had
taken no notice of Carl, who, while he listened to their
words, contorted his face in such a manner that it would
have been difficult to decide whether he was laughing or
crying. He placed his hands over his face; but between
his fingers his eyes could be seen peering out with a peculiar
expression at Magde.</p>

<p><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>"I will no longer feign ignorance of your meaning,
father," replied Magde, with a visible effort to suppress
her anger. "It is true that in words, and even in actions,
he has conducted himself with more presumption than he
would have dared to assume last winter; but fear not, I
well know how to protect the honor of my name."</p>

<p>"And as you thus speak you vainly endeavor to conceal
your emotions," said the old man suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Do not think that he has endeavored to plant his snare
for a simple dove. When he would snatch his prize, he
may learn that I possess both beak and talons."</p>

<p>"Well, my child," replied Mr. Lonner, with a laugh,
"it is a fortunate chance that you are the daughter of a
father who was a man of the world; but your birth entitled
you to a higher position in life than that which you
now occupy."</p>

<p>"You speak strangely, father."</p>

<p>"Why, you might have married Mr. Trystedt who possessed
riches and lands, while now you live in absolute
poverty."</p>

<p>"Why should you think of that? Is it not better to
live in poverty with love, than to possess untold riches
without love? Does the whole earth contain a better husband
than my Ragnar? Is he not a skillful sailor? I have
no doubt but that had he not been married he would long
ago have been promoted to a captaincy. He is a thousand
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>times more of a gentleman, at any time, than that old
Trystedt, who was a torment to all he whom he met."</p>

<p>"Thank God! If you are satisfied, then all is right,
and even if we are at present in straightened circumstances
all will be made right when Jonson arrives. I hope
that he will be careful of the goods entrusted to him."</p>

<p>A slight noise in an adjoining room, notified the mother
that her infant child had awakened. She instantly arose
and left the apartment. Magde was a dignified and elegant
woman, although her countenance was pleasing
rather than beautiful, and as she moved towards the door
the old man's eyes followed her with a gaze of admiration
and love.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Husband and Wife.</span></h3>


<p>About a half a mile from the valley&mdash;the name of which
we shall conceal, as many personages who are to play a
part in our little story are still living&mdash;was situated the
estate of Almvik, which the present proprietor Fabian
H&mdash;&mdash;, had purchased one year before, and had immediately
removed thither with his family.</p>

<p>Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, and above all his puissant wife Mistress
Ulrica Eugenia, her proper name, but which she had afterwards
tortured into the more refined patronymic, Ulrique
Eugenie&mdash;were individuals who moved in the higher
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>classes of society, at least he who should endeavor to
prove to the contrary would find the task a thankless one.</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian H&mdash;&mdash;, imagined himself a second Brutus,
that is to say; he was fully convinced that the time would
certainly arrive when he should arouse himself from his
present listlessness; when he should be released from the
thraldom of his wife, and awaken to renewed strength and
vigor. But it was much to be feared that poor Brutus
never would realize his bright anticipations of liberty.</p>

<p>Mistress Ulrica Eugenia was characterized by a strong
desire to assist in the work of emancipating women from
the tyranny of men, and that she might forward the good
work she had entirely set at naught the command that a
wife should obey her husband; she openly declared that
the ancient law which compelled the woman to subserve to
the man, was but a concoction of man himself, that the
Bible itself never contained such an absurd command, but
that the translators, who she triumphantly affirmed were
men, had placed that law in the scripture, merely to suit
their own selfish ends. She also affirmed that she would
stake her life upon the issue that she would not find, even
if she should search the scriptures through, such an
absurd command. And she was right. <i>She</i> would not
find it.</p>

<p>In the immediate neighborhood of Almvik, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; was
reverenced as a wealthy nobleman, and a man of
power. He wished to be considered a hospitable man,
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>and frequently rejoiced his neighbors with invitations to
visit his beautiful estate. To him strangers were godsends.
He entertained them to the best of his ability,
invited the neighbors to see them, and although his little
soirees were very pleasant, still, as the guests were drawn
from all classes of society, many amusing scenes were
enacted, in all of which, Mistress Ulrica Eugenia performed
a prominent and independent part.</p>

<p>Although Mrs. Ulrica had liberated herself from all
obedience to her legal master, and had in fact assumed
the reins of government herself, she nevertheless possessed
some, if not a great deal of affection for the rosy cheeks and
sleepy eyes of her husband, and at the same time she kept
a watchful eye upon those whom she suspected of partaking
with her in this sentiment. Not only was Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; occasionally
aggravated by the pangs of jealousy, but she
was also tormented by the thought that her husband entirely
confided in her own fidelity, thus at once cutting off
the possibility of a love quarrel and a reconciliation.</p>

<p>Upon the evening when we first made the personal
acquaintance of the inmates of Almvik, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; and
his wife were riding out in their gig; for in the morning
they rode in a light hunting wagon, and at noon they used
the large family coach.</p>

<p>Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, immediately before starting forth on the
ride had received a severe lecture from his spouse, because
he indulged in an afternoon's nap, instead of devising
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>means for the amusement of the family, that is, of the
worthy dame herself, and their only treasure, the little
Eugene Ulrich, and Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, we say, never felt inclined
for sprightly conversation after such a lecture.</p>

<p>He well knew that he would be obliged to succumb in
everything; but like a stubborn boy, who is punished by
being compelled to stand in a corner until shame forces
him to submit, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; determined, to speak figuratively&mdash;to
stand silently in that corner the entire day rather than
to acknowledge himself conquered.</p>

<p>That was, at least, one point gained, towards his emancipation.
It cannot but be supposed, however, that, if the
lecture had been upon any other subject less trivial than
the mere act of sleeping, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; would have undoubtedly
acted in an entirely different manner. At least that
is the only excuse we can find for his conduct on this
occasion.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mistress Ulrica, straightening herself up
in her seat with the utmost dignity, "upon my honor, Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash;, you are a <i>very</i> agreeable companion."</p>

<p>"I am obliged to be careful while driving."</p>

<p>"Is it necessary that you should sit there as dumb as a
fence post?"</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I must say that your sulkiness is not to be
envied. Suppose some one should see us&mdash;I mean you&mdash;why
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>they would readily believe that your wife was an old
woman."</p>

<p>"Now, now, my dear Ulrique Eugenie, don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your dear Ulrique Eugenie is not yet thirty eight
years old, and even though you are two years younger, I
do not think that should make any difference."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, on the contrary," grumbled her husband,
chuckling inwardly.</p>

<p>"I do not know but what your words have a double
meaning; but Fabian, <i>we</i> must not quarrel, let us become
reconciled, there is my hand."</p>

<p>"Your heart ever overflows with the milk of human
kindness, my dear," said he.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear husband,&mdash;but can you imagine
what I really intended to say?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I cannot."</p>

<p>"I intended to say, should you ever cast your eyes
upon another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"God forbid!"</p>

<p>"You may well say God forbid, am I not your wife,
who will not allow her rights to be trodden under foot?"</p>

<p>"Am I not aware of that?"</p>

<p>"Even if you are, my dear, there is no harm in my
saying that if I should discover the slightest cause which
would arouse my suspicion I would scratch out your
eyes!"</p>

<p>"Sweet <i>Ulgenie</i>!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><i>Ulgenie</i>, a word which the reader will observe, is compounded
from the words Ulrica and Eugenie, was one of
those contorted terms of endearment, which Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash; permitted
her husband to use during their moments of tenderness.
Should he wish to address her in an extremely
affectionate manner, he would term her his "pet Ulte,"
an expression which had also originated in the fertile mind
of the loving wife!</p>

<p>On this occasion the husband considered the first expression
sufficiently affectionate, and in all probability many
tender recollections were associated with those three
syllables, for no sooner had he uttered the name "Ulgenie,"
than she cast her eyes downward with an unusual
gentle expression, and in a changed tone of voice, she whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never again my dearest husband shall we differ in our
opinions. Equality in marriage renders it a useful institution;
but to change the subject, it is long since you
have made any hunting excursions, dear Fabian, to-morrow
you must go."</p>

<p>As Mistress Ulrica was determined that her husband
should become a skillful sportsman, she gave him rest
neither night nor day, unless he devoted at least two days
of the week to hunting or fishing excursions. Not that
Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; was a sportsman; but that it afforded his wife
great pleasure to inform her guests, that a certain moorcock
was killed by her dear Fabian, or that he had caught
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>the pike which then graced their table, for, she would add
complacently, her Fabian was well aware that she took
great delight in eating the game taken by his skillful
hand.</p>

<p>Therefore there were no means of escape for him, he
must by force become a sportsman, for a wife who is laboring
for the emancipation of womankind, never will permit her
desires to remain ungratified. During the conversation
the vehicle approached the mansion. Mr. Fabian H&mdash;&mdash;,
during the entire ride, had thought upon the pipe and sofa
which awaited him upon his return, for he smoked like a
Turk, and loved the ease of oriental life. There was one
pursuit, however, which afforded him still greater pleasure,
and that was to ogle other men's wives, for he was
an unfortunate son of Adam, never being able to discover
beauties which his wife might have possessed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Who can that be!" exclaimed Mistress Ulrica Eugenia
as the gig entered the court-yard, "who is that elegant
young man descending the door steps? is it possible that
he is my nephew little Gottlieb?"</p>

<p>"Yes he is, my dear Aunt Ulrica, I was little Gottlieb,
but I have grown up to be big Gottlieb," answered a cheerful
voice, and the next moment the young man whose
acquaintance we have before made, embraced the lady
warmly, and then heartily shook his uncle's extended hand.<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>
Uncle Fabian however, was not overjoyed at his wife's
determination of introducing into his house a stripling who
might perhaps become a spy upon his actions and make
reports that would call forth the entire vigor of his wife's
tongue.</p>

<p>After the first torrent of welcomings, questions and
answers,&mdash;for Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; did not dare do otherwise than
to cordially welcome his guest&mdash;had subsided, and the
family had entered the dining room, and the hostess had
pressed the acceptance of a third cup of tea upon the
young man, who was already sufficiently heated without
undergoing this ordeal; she thus addressed him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, my dear little Gottlieb, you look remarkably
well, you little rogue. Is it really true that you have
made this long journey to see us on foot?"</p>

<p>"It is indeed true; this green coat is my usual costume
when I do not wear a blouse, which is my favorite garment.
My better apparel is contained within my knapsack,
and thus I have given you an invoice of my wardrobe,
which you see, my dear aunt, is not very extensive."</p>

<p>"But your under-clothes, my child?"</p>

<p>"What, under-clothes, do you think I could give my
dear uncle so much trouble as to bring linen clothes with
me?"</p>

<p>"What a careless fellow you are!"</p>

<p>"'You have now,' said my mother, when I took my
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>leave, 'you have now four rare pieces of linen, styled
shirts; but when you return, you must travel by steam,
for you will undoubtedly possess twenty-four!'"</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied his aunt, with a smile, "I understand
you now."</p>

<p>"How do you understand me?" inquired Gottlieb.</p>

<p>"As belonging to that class of persons, sir, who never
find themselves at a loss," replied uncle Fabian, in a tone
of voice which he intended should be overwhelming.</p>

<p>Gottlieb, however, was not inclined to be thus easily
driven from the field. "You have hit the nail upon the
head," said he, with an assumed expression of respect for
the decision of his uncle, "and it is by the means of that
very trait of character which you have mentioned, that I
hope to work myself through the world, although I am
only the son of a poor secretary in a government office,
who is embarrassed by debt and a large family, thus you
perceive I cannot depend solely upon the whims of
fortune."</p>

<p>"What then are your prospects for the future?" inquired
the lady seriously.</p>

<p>"I have but one," replied Gottlieb.</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"My plan is very simple, I have thoroughly studied
financial matters, and in the fall intend to help my father
in his office, so that he can spare the services of his two
assistants. He will then have only one salary to pay; but<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>
I think that I can do the work of three, and as I intend to
become a model of order, capability and energy, I hope to
be able to win the favor of the head of the treasury
department, so that when my father, who at present is in a
very feeble state of health, shall be obliged to resign, I may
be appointed in his stead. This is my plan."</p>

<p>"You are a shrewd young man," said Mistress Ulrica.</p>

<p>"It is not necessary to be shrewd when the high road is
plain before you."</p>

<p>"But at least you must possess sufficient knowledge of
the world to prevent you, in your youth, from leaving the
high road, and wasting your time in useless dreaming."</p>

<p>"Of dreaming, he who has nothing but his head and
hands to depend on, must not be afraid. If one wishes to
enjoy pleasant dreams, he must not trouble his head about
that which he is to eat when he awakes."</p>

<p>"Good! good!" exclaimed Ulrica, "I hope that your
wise plans will succeed, and I do not doubt but what they
will, they are so well laid, and aside from that you are not
striving for yourself alone, but for your parents, to whom
I am sure you will always prove a dutiful and grateful
child."</p>

<p>"That is why I should become my father's successor,
dear aunt. Had I not thought of this plan, I would undoubtedly
have formed some other; but with this I am
satisfied."</p>

<p><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>"And do you intend to afford us the pleasure of your
company this summer?" inquired uncle Fabian, abruptly.</p>

<p>"With your permission, dear uncle, your invitation
arrived at a lucky moment, as it came during my vacation."</p>

<p>"Well, well, nephew," said Mrs. Ulrica, "we will go
and prepare a chamber for you."</p>

<p>"Nephew, nephew," exclaimed Gottlieb, merrily, "why
we look more like cousins!"</p>

<p>"You are a little wag!"</p>

<p>"O, I must say more. My mother might have been
your mother also, from all appearances."</p>

<p>"Ah, I was a mere girl when she was married. She
was the eldest while I was the youngest of the family, and
the fourteen years discrepancy between our ages accounts
for the differences in our appearance."</p>

<p>"And riches and fortune also," added Gottlieb; "poor
mother, misfortune has always been her lot; and although
she has much trouble, she has nevertheless an angel's forbearance."</p>

<p>"Her disposition resembles mine more than her person
does," said Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;, casting a glance of tender inquiry
upon her husband.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," replied he, "your angelic disposition
and patience are well known."</p>

<p>He well understood the smile with which his wife had
accompanied her words.</p>

<p><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>"Good Fabian, you know how to appreciate your
wife!"</p>

<p>"Sweet Ulgenie!"</p>

<p>Gottlieb glanced from his aunt to his uncle.</p>

<p>"Strange people these," thought he. "I think they are
playing bo-peep with each other, or perhaps they are blinding
me; well, I care not; so long as they do not disturb
me, I will not meddle with their affairs."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Attic-Rooms.</span></h3>


<p>As we have before stated, Nanna had supreme control
over one of the attic-rooms of the cottage, and for a long
time it had been a sanctuary in which she stored her precious
things.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Lonner loved Nanna as the apple of his eye.
She was not only the youngest child, and consequently the
favorite, but she also possessed strong perceptive qualities,
and a heart susceptible of the tenderest emotions.
She was, so to speak, a living emblem of those harmonious
dreams that her father in his youth had hoped to see
realized.</p>

<p><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>The pale and delicate countenance of Nanna, who he
thought was destined in all probability to droop and die
like a water lily, which she so much resembled, carried the
old man's mind back to the time when his father had
promised to wed his mother, and he sighed as he thought
how different Nanna's station in life would have been had
that promise been fulfilled. Instead of neglect and insult,
homage from all would have been her portion.</p>

<p>Yet Nanna was the pride and joy of her father's heart,
for Ragnar, who at an early age was obliged to labor for
his own support, had preferred to become a sailor, rather
than to acquire a refined education, and Carl could scarcely
comprehend more than that which was necessary for
the performance of family worship. Nanna, on the contrary,
would listen to her father with the utmost pleasure and
interest as he related and explained matters and things
which were entirely novel to one placed in her position of
life.</p>

<p>And then, with what eagerness would Nanna read those
few books with which her father's little library was supplied!
She fully comprehended all she read, and she could
not resist from becoming gently interested in the characters
described in her books. She sympathised with the
unhappy and oppressed, and although she rejoiced with
those happy heroes and heroines who had passed safely
through the ordeals of their loves, yet when she read of
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>the fortunate conclusion of all their troubles, she would
sigh deeply.</p>

<p>But after sighing for those who <i>had</i> lived, she sighed
also for the <i>living</i>.</p>

<p>She looked forward, with terror, to the day when she
should lose her father, whom she worshipped almost as a
supreme being.</p>

<p>Her innocent heart shrunk within her as she thought
of the time when a man,&mdash;for these thoughts had already
entered her little head&mdash;should look into her eyes in search
of a wife. Who shall that man be? she thought. Is it
possible that he can be any other than a peasant or a fisherman?
Perhaps he may be even worse; a common day-laborer
of the parish.</p>

<p>O, that would be impossible!</p>

<p>Such a rude uncouth husband would prove her death.
How could she entertain the same thoughts, after her
marriage with such a boor, as she had before? He could
never sympathise with her. No, she would be obliged to
remain unmarried for ever. Perhaps not even a laborer
would wed her! On St. John's eve, when she had ventured
to attend the ball, did any body request her to dance?
No, not one, no, they only gazed at Mademoiselle Nanna,
with a stupid and imbecile stare&mdash;<i>she</i> did not belong to
their class.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>The next evening after Nanna had encountered the young
stranger near the spring, she was seated alone in her
bed-chamber. During the entire day she had endeavored
to assist her sister-in law, in the various domestic duties,
with her usual activity; which however it must be confessed,
was mingled with much pensive abstraction. But after
the tea service was removed, she had retired to her chamber,
that she might in solitude commune with her own
thoughts.</p>

<p>The silence of her apartment was soothing to Nanna's
mind.</p>

<p>Besides a small sofa, which was her sleeping place, her
little dominions contained a book shelf; three or four
flower vases; a bureau, and a small work table. The two
latter articles of furniture were specimens of Carl's workmanship.</p>

<p>Carl, when he <i>chose</i> to display his ability, was a skillful
carpenter, and formerly Nanna was his special favorite.
Of late, however, it could readily be perceived that Magde
possessed his affections. She, had she so chosen, could
have abused him as if he had been a dog, and like a cur he
would have crept back to kiss the hand which had maltreated
him. Magde, however, was soft-hearted, and did
not abuse her power over the singular boy; but she compelled
him to labor with much more assiduity than he had
formerly. When at home, Carl generally performed the
duties of a nursery maid. The children remained with him
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>willingly, for he tenderly loved them; in fact every child in
the neighborhood loved the "Wiseacre," for he would play
with them, and upon all occasions take them under his
special protection. When he saw his little nephews and
nieces, subjected to the discipline of their mother, he would
fly into a frenzy of passion, and then he was called, "Crazy
Carl." He was an inveterate enemy to corporeal punishment,
and he could invent no better method of explaining
his doctrine, than by administering to those, who differed
with him, a practical illustration of the cruelty of personal
castigation. Therefore he would fly around among the
parents and the straggling children, preventing their punishment
of his favorites by means of his own stalwart arm,
and then after the tumult had subsided he would repent
and tearfully sue for pardon.</p>

<p>Crazy Carl was laughed at for his exertions in behalf
of the children, yet to spare his feelings the necessary
punishment of the children was deferred till he was out of
sight. None of the neighboring peasant women would
leave their homes, to go to the market, to a wedding, or to
a funeral, without requesting Carl to remain with the children,
and upon his compliance they would go forth untroubled,
for they were well aware of the unbounded influence
"Wiseacre" possessed over the young people.</p>

<p>Carl's bed-room, which adjoined Nanna's apartment, contained
a bedstead, a well whittled table, and a chair
mutilated in a like manner. In this chair Carl would rock
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>backward and forward, for hours, and with half closed
eyes would look as if by stealth, at a striped woolen waistcoat,
which was suspended against the wall, or some other
little gift from Magde.</p>

<p>At the same time that Nanna was seated in her room
looking towards the large tree near the spring, Carl was
rocking in his chair, gazing with his peculiar expression
at a brown earthen vase, which was standing upon the
table before him. The vase contained two freshly plucked
lilacs, one blue and the other white, which emitted a
fragrant odor. After Carl had sufficiently regarded these
objects, he slowly jerked his chair towards the table, and
at each pause his mouth widened into a simple simper. At
length he arrived so near the table that by bending forward
he could have easily touched the flowers with his nostrils.
To accomplish this movement, which was his evident intention,
he proceeded with as much gravity and carefulness
as he had evinced in approaching the table. He bowed
down his head inch by inch, until he could no longer withstand
the desire of his senses. With one plunge he thrust
his nostrils amidst the fresh leaves of the fragrant flowers.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, he raised his head, a thought struck
his mind&mdash;his face lengthened and his brow became cloudy.</p>

<p>And yet a few moments ago he appeared supremely
happy.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>Nanna's pretty face was pressed against the window pane.
Her little world had never before appeared so
fresh and beautiful. So great was her abstraction that
she did not hear the door open, as Carl with his peculiar
lofty strides entered the room.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Nanna," said Carl. Nanna did not hear
him. His voice was lost in her recollection of the words
of the strange youth, she had met the day before.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Nanna," repeated Carl.</p>

<p>Nanna started. "What for?" said she.</p>

<p>"Do you not know?" replied Carl, "why for the
flowers!"</p>

<p>"Flowers?"</p>

<p>"O," said Carl smiling imbecilely and gazing vacantly
around the room.</p>

<p>"If you found lilacs in your room, I did not place them
there," said Nanna.</p>

<p>"Ah! then perhaps little Christine sent them to me."</p>

<p>"No, dear Carl," replied Nanna, "the flowers were
sent by one who is better than even myself or Christine."</p>

<p>"Who can it be?"</p>

<p>"Magde, of course."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Carl slowly stepped towards the door. "Magde,
yes, I ought to have known that!"</p>

<p>"Ask her, and then you will know certainly," said
Nanna.</p>

<p><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>"O, no, but they are beautiful flowers. I hope I will
not break them, they smell so sweetly!"</p>

<p>Thus saying Carl strode across the floor to his own chamber
where he again seated himself upon his chair and resumed
his former occupation; but he did not profane them
with his nostrils, for now he regarded them in a holier light.
They were Magde's gift.</p>

<p>While he was thus happily engaged, a messenger arrived
at the cottage to disturb him. A peasant's wife, who
wished to attend a funeral desired his services, and the
obliging Carl, although he protested that he had a great
deal to engage his attention at home, willingly promised
to go to the woman's cottage and take care of her children
until her return. In order that his arrival at the cottage
might be joyfully welcomed, he returned to his room, and
commenced the manufacture of sundry whistles and as he
whittled and sung verses of his own composition&mdash;for
Carl was a poet&mdash;he occasionally cast loving glances towards
the brown earthen vase.</p>

<p>But how was Nanna employed? Was she reading some
of her favorite books, an amusement to which she often
devoted her leisure hours? or perhaps she was proceeding
over the path which conducted to the spring in the meadow.
Neither. She at present appeared perfectly satisfied
with her unaccustomed listlessness, from which however
she was soon aroused.</p>

<p>From between the trees that bordered the side of the
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>hill, she saw a green coat emerge, which when it reached
the plain made its way towards the little fountain beneath
the tree.</p>

<p>The wearer of the coat, who was the young man who
had carried the knapsack and had called Nanna his little
naiad, a term which he supposed she did not understand,
cast himself upon the grass near the trunk of the tree.
Perhaps he was expecting some one.</p>

<p>For a few moments Nanna stood undecidedly upon the
threshold of the door. Her inclinations drew her towards
the spring; but her modesty cautioned her to remain.</p>

<p>Why had she so long postponed her usual walk on this
particular occasion? She had not expected any one.
Certainly not!</p>

<p>At length, however, she seized her bonnet and hastened
from the room.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The First Disappointment.</span></h3>


<p>Nanna had arrived at the bottom step of the flight of
stairs, when she encountered Magde who was returning
from a visit at a neighbor's house. She had walked fast,
and her face was crimson with heat and vexation. When
Magde first saw the young girl, she drew her bonnet close
around her face, intending to enter the house as quickly as
Nanna wished to depart; but when Nanna had reached
the threshold she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To take a little walk," replied Nanna.</p>

<p><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>"Be careful, Nanna," said Magde seriously, "you will
soon be a young woman."</p>

<p>"And why should that affect you so?" replied Nanna,
astonished at Magde's caution.</p>

<p>"O, only that poor women who wish to preserve their
fair fame, are not allowed to go out when they choose."</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"I say that the sun, earth, water, trees, and flowers,
are made only for the rich, who can admire them from
their fine carriages and pleasure yachts."</p>

<p>"But, dear Magde, you have always&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, child," interrupted Magde, "you do not know
the insults to which we females of humble birth are exposed."</p>

<p>"We are not born that we should thus be insulted,"
said Nanna.</p>

<p>"True, true; but then we should have been born as
deformed and ugly as those sins, which even our modesty
will not preserve us from being suspected of."</p>

<p>"Can that be possible!" thought Nanna. Magde, who
as she spoke had passed her hand upon her forehead, now
removed it, and from the expression of her dark eyes,
which beamed with her accustomed cheerfulness, and from
her proud and lofty bearing, it could be perceived that she
had regained her usual self-possession.</p>

<p>"I grieve you, dear Nanna," said she in a softened tone
of voice, "I do not imagine you to be more than a dove
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>which is still fostered within the dovecote. But I was
troubled, as I am sometimes, without really knowing the
cause."</p>

<p>"Is there no cause, then?" inquired Nanna.</p>

<p>"I can say that there is or is not a cause, and therefore
shall remain silent."</p>

<p>"Then remain silent, dear Magde, let us speak no further
on the subject," said Nanna quickly, for she was
burning with impatience to visit the spring.</p>

<p>She longed to discover by experience whether it was
really so dangerous for a woman to walk out alone.</p>

<p>Until the day before, it had not been dangerous, for no
one had forbidden her the free enjoyment of God's beautiful
earth, and neither had her modesty ever been insulted.
On any other occasion, Nanna would have been influenced
not only by curiosity, but by a far purer feeling, namely,
sympathy for Magde's sorrows,&mdash;for she dearly loved her
sister-in-law,&mdash;and would have asked an explanation of
matters which she at present was anxious to avoid.</p>

<p>Magde was silent.</p>

<p>Nanna stepped over the door sill.</p>

<p>But stern fate compelled her to turn back a second
time, for the moment that Magde turned to pass into the
house, old Mr. Lonner advanced to the door.</p>

<p>"Nanna my child," said he, "bring my chair out into
the door-yard. The evening air is so cool and pleasant
that it will invigorate my old body; but it would be better<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>
I think, if my rheumatism will permit it, to take a little
stroll in the fields, with the aid of my walking cane on one
side, and with you as a staff to support me on the other."</p>

<p>Nanna blushed so deeply that she felt the blood burning
her cheeks, as she advanced the opinion that the exercise
might prove injurious to him.</p>

<p>"Poor child, you are grieved on account of your old
father. I will take your advice. Bring my arm-chair
out, and we will sit here and have a little chat together."</p>

<p>Hitherto, when her father had chatted to her of all that
he had seen and experienced, Nanna had considered herself
amply rewarded for her days of labor, but on this
occasion, she not only went after the chair reluctantly, but
also, when she as usual seated herself with her knitting
work on her little bench at his side she sighed
deeply. Her father did not observe her dejection, perhaps
he considered it an impossibility for his precious jewel to
sigh when she was with him.</p>

<p>"Well, Nanna," said he stroking his long beard which
gave a venerable appearance to his benevolent features,
"are you thinking of the fine shawl that Ragnar is to send
you by his friend Jon Jonson?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, dear father," replied Nanna.</p>

<p>"True," continued the old man, "your disposition in
that respect does not resemble Magde's. She is pleased,
as every young woman should be, when she has an opportunity
of decorating her person with elegant clothing."</p>

<p><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>"I think, that hereafter," said Nanna, slightly confused,
"I shall also cultivate a taste for such things; but thus
far I have had but little opportunity."</p>

<p>"I hope so," replied her father, "I have frequently
been much troubled in mind, when I have observed your
indifference to dress, so unnatural to one of your age;
but which is only a result of the romantic notions that
you have always indulged in."</p>

<p>"But dear father, is it not wrong to strive to make ourselves
beautiful when we are only poor people?"</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" exclaimed the old man, "what put that
into your little head?"</p>

<p>"Magde told me that all poor women ought to be born
ugly, that their reputation might not be suspected."</p>

<p>"Magde was a little out of humor, when she said that,
and she who wishes to please her husband so much, could
not have really intended what she said."</p>

<p>"Yes, but when a woman is married, it alters the case
entirely."</p>

<p>"But why should not an unmarried girl wish herself
handsome for the sake of her father, her brother, and
above all for her own sake? That is a good wish so
long as it continues innocent."</p>

<p>"When then, is it not innocent?" inquired Nanna.</p>

<p>"It is no longer innocent when the love of fine apparel,
and the desire to be beautiful, changes the heart, and the
girl neglects her duties, and gives her sole attention to
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>that which should only serve as a simple recreation; but
that I am sure will never be the case with you."</p>

<p>Nanna was silent. She drooped her head. "There is
no danger of that," thought she, "for who will care to witness
the change?"</p>

<p>"On next St. John's day," continued her father, "you
must wear that elegant silk shawl which belonged to your
poor mother."</p>

<p>As Nanna heard these words, a smile of peculiar meaning
passed over her lips. It was the smile of a woman
who anticipates a future triumph.</p>

<p>"Thank God," said the old man, turning the conversation
in another channel, "for all the blessings he has bestowed
upon us. Although we may now be in trouble,
when Ragnar's packages arrive, we shall be in better circumstances.
Poverty has many blessings of which the
rich man cannot even dream. The poor man's gratitude and
joy for even the slightest piece of fortune is too great to
describe. The rich man has not that relish for the good
things of life that the poor man has."</p>

<p>While honest Lonner was thus losing himself in his
meditations, Nanna moved in her seat uneasily, and dropped
stitch after stitch of her knitting-work. The former
topic of conversation was endurable, but this&mdash;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, she did not dare to express her
desire to be liberated from her irksome position. Why
was she afraid to do so? She asked herself the question;
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>the only reply she could make was, that yesterday it
would have been easy for her to say, "Father, I want to
take a little walk in the meadow;" but to-day, oh! that
was different!</p>

<p>"I see you have your bonnet on!" said her father,
"were you about taking a walk?"</p>

<p>"I have not been out of the house before, to-day,"
replied Nanna.</p>

<p>"Well, then run away, my child; take all the enjoyment
you can. You have but little here."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was by expressions of this description from
her father, that mournful thoughts were engendered within
the mind of the young girl, causing her to fancy that something
was wanting to complete her happiness, and that she
stood beyond the pale of those who should have been her
companions.</p>

<p>It is certainly plausible to suppose that these moments
which the old man had set apart for familiar conversation
with his daughter, whom he loved above all earthly things,
for she reminded him of past days, might have proved
highly detrimental to Nanna's sensitive and susceptible
mind.</p>

<p>As matters now stood, it was plainly evident that, however
economical, industrious and thrifty she might be,
Nanna would be compelled to be content with her lot,
should she wed an honest mechanic or a sloop captain,
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>which were the highest prizes which she, or any of the
neighboring maidens, might expect to win.</p>

<p>Like a captive bird which, after many fruitless struggles,
finally regains its liberty, Nanna quickly made use of her
restored freedom, and hastened from the door-yard. She
was fully convinced that the young man was no longer in
the meadow, and now she suddenly remembered that she
had said nothing to her father or Magde about the stranger
whom she had encountered the previous evening.
How strange it was that she had forgotten to tell them!
Yes, it was the strangest thing that ever had occurred
during her whole life, and how greatly astonished they
would be when she should tell them of her little adventure!
Thus thought Nanna, as she proceeded towards the
meadow.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Agreement.</span></h3>


<p>"It was just as I thought!" exclaimed our heroine, as
she looked, with pouting lips at the reflection of her pretty
figure in the clear waters of the spring. Never before
had her hair been so nicely arranged, and her neat white
apron, which she had kept concealed beneath her cloak
during her entire conversation with Magde and her father,
and which she had carefully tied about her waist as soon
as she had entered the meadows, how pretty it looked!
But how was she repaid for all her trouble? She was
about disencumbering herself both of her apron and a
little scarf which she had thrown over her shoulders, when
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>she heard a voice that she had already learned to distinguish,
calling to her in the distance.</p>

<p>With pleased astonishment she lifted her eyes, and saw
an individual whom we need scarcely inform our readers
was the owner of the knapsack. He was descending a
hill, holding to his lips a blade of grass, upon which he
would occasionally blow a vigorous and ear-piercing
blast.</p>

<p>"Have you come at last, my naiad queen?" said the
youth. "We were such pleasant companions last evening,
that I came hither in the hope of finding you at your bath
again."</p>

<p>"A naiad queen might bathe her feet before you; but
I&mdash;" She ceased speaking, and a deep blush suffused
her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Ah! then you know something about the naiads, my
child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and about the sylphs, too," replied Nanna, nodding
her head, proud at having an opportunity of displaying
her knowledge before one whom, besides her father,
was the only person that she had ever cared to interest.</p>

<p>"You surprise me! What have you read?"</p>

<p>"O, a little of everything. My father has a large book
case, and I have a small collection of books, myself."</p>

<p>"Hm, hm," said the embryo secretary, "but enumerate
to me some of the books you have read."</p>

<p>"Do you really wish to know?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>"Yes, dear Nanna,&mdash;pardon me&mdash;Mademoiselle Nanna
I should have said. Now Mademoiselle, please be seated,
the grass is quite soft. I wish to catechise you a little."</p>

<p>"But I shall not answer you, sir, if you call me Mademoiselle;
it sounds so cold and disagreeable."</p>

<p>"Well, I will be careful not to do so; but let us make a
commencement."</p>

<p>"With my qualifications?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; but why do you sit at such a distance?"</p>

<p>"We are not so far from each other."</p>

<p>"That proves you to be no mathematician. Now, tell
me, how many yards distance are there between us?"</p>

<p>"Three, I think."</p>

<p>"Poor child, you have not reached your A B C's in
arithmetic; but I will be your instructor."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"You shall soon see." He quickly unloosed his neckcloth.
"This," he continued, "is precisely one yard in
length. Now, I will measure the ground, and when I have
measured three yards, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Then I will seat myself; for you have yourself chosen
the distance."</p>

<p>The unsuspecting Nanna had not the slightest idea of
the little plot the young man had arranged to entrap her.
The poor child was unaccustomed to mirth; for although
Magde, Ragnar, and Carl, often indulged in boisterous
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>sports, still Nanna never could feel an inclination to mingle
with them, but had merely smiled at their ridiculous jokes.
Never had the clear ringing laugh of gleeful childhood
issued over her lips; but upon the present occasion her
innocent heart entered into the spirit of her gay companion,
and when he deliberately measured three lengths of
his neckcloth from the spot where he was sitting, and then
gravely seated himself at her very side, a merry laugh broke
from her lips, in which the youth joined.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, assuming a comfortable position, "I
can touch you, at least, now."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Nanna seriously, for she was musing
on Magde's words of caution, "yes, you can; but I do not
wish you to."</p>

<p>"You do not?"</p>

<p>"I do not," replied she firmly.</p>

<p>"What an obstinate little creature you are!"</p>

<p>"You desired to know what I have read," said Nanna,
wishing to change the subject of conversation.</p>

<p>"True, but why do you hide your little hand under
your apron, I shall not touch it without your permission?"</p>

<p>Nanna smiled as she slowly withdrew her hands from
their place of concealment and folded them upon her lap.</p>

<p>"Now, my child," said the young man with an assumed
air of dignity, "first of all, you may commence at the beginning."</p>

<p>"When I was a little girl, my father bought for me
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>some picture books, which as I read, he explained to me.
Next as I progressed further&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what happened?"</p>

<p>"Next I studied the catechism, which I liked very much,
then I commenced reading the bible, a book which I love
above all others, the new testament especially. All that I do
not understand my father explains to me, and after he
has finished, I go alone to my room, and as I read I cannot
refrain from weeping&mdash;But my tears are not sorrowful,
I think only of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"I know not whether I should tell you that."</p>

<p>"Certainly you should; am I not your friend?"</p>

<p>"Well then&mdash;but do not speak about it to any one&mdash;I
cannot help thinking that if I had lived when our Saviour
was upon earth, I should have been one of the holy
women."</p>

<p>"Who ever heard of such ambition! Why perhaps you
would like to have been the virgin Mary, herself?"</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed Nanna, turning her face, that she
might conceal the blush, which his words of ridicule, as
she esteemed them, had called forth.</p>

<p>"But, my child," continued her companion, "we will
dwell no longer upon your holy thoughts, so different
from others of your age; proceed if you please."</p>

<p>"Aside from the books I have mentioned, at my father's
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>request, I studied history, geography, natural philosophy,
and finally ancient mythology."</p>

<p>"You surprise me! Your education has not been neglected;
but you can write, can you not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, and I have also practised drawing a little."</p>

<p>"Indeed! upon my honor, Mademoiselle Nanna you frighten
me!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I cannot comprehend how you can use all
your knowledge in this valley."</p>

<p>"I have often thought of that," replied Nanna, sighing
deeply.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, it is not such a terrible matter after all,"
said Gottlieb, "I must thoroughly convince myself."</p>

<p>Gottlieb now commenced to examine and cross-question
Nanna in the various departments of learning that she had
mentioned, and was pleased to discover by her accurate
replies that she comprehended thoroughly all that she had
studied. In fact, Nanna was quite his equal in her knowledge
of Ancient Mythology, which had always been her
favorite study.</p>

<p>"But how is it possible that your father should be so
well educated? Yesterday, when we were walking together,
you told me that he had resided in this valley nearly
half his lifetime, with scarcely sufficient means to support
himself and family."</p>

<p>"Alas! a sorrowful story is connected with my father's
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>younger days; but he never speaks of it. He had high
hopes, when young, and had they been realized, he would
have been a man of consequence; but the death of his
patron crushed everything."</p>

<p>"I must call upon your father some pleasant evening.
Do you think he would be pleased to see me?"</p>

<p>"Of course, and Magde would also."</p>

<p>"Your sister-in-law? Well, well, I will soon visit them
both; but listen now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"As the error has already been committed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What error?"</p>

<p>"That you should have been taught more than you
ought to know; but still, it is now too late to repent as you
have already learned a little, and I do not think there will
be any harm in teaching you more."</p>

<p>"Who will teach me?"</p>

<p>"I shall of course.&mdash;I have an idea."</p>

<p>Nanna glanced inquiringly towards her companion.
"You might be able," he continued, "to earn a little competency
for yourself; would you be willing to become a
school-teacher?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, nothing could be better! Then I would not
be obliged to think of&mdash;of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of marriage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of marriage."</p>

<p><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>"And I am of your opinion, for to speak candidly,
whom could you marry?"</p>

<p>"I do not know; there is the parish tailor, who has
already spoken to Magde about it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The parish tailor!&mdash;Aha!"</p>

<p>"And Captain Larsson who owns a sloop, offered Ragnar
two barrels of rye flour if he would speak a good
word to me about him."</p>

<p>"Two barrels of rye flour as a bribe! And your brother's
reply?"</p>

<p>"O, Ragnar is not to be played with," replied Nanna; "'if
you wish to purchase my sister,' said he, 'you had better
speak to her yourself, she has not authorized me to
sell her.'"</p>

<p>"So you have two lovers!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the sexton, an old widower, is the third.
He has considerable wealth, and therefore applied to my
father, himself."</p>

<p>"Without success?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father told him I was too young."</p>

<p>"Do you not prefer either of your suitors?"</p>

<p>"I would rather throw myself into lake Wenner, than
to marry either of them."</p>

<p>"Then let us speak of the school. It will give you a
little income, and is, as far as I can see, the only method
of using your accomplishments to advantage."</p>

<p>"You are right. It is my only choice."</p>
<p><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></p>
<p>"I fear so too, for a lover suitable for you would not in
all probability find his way hither; but in me you have
found a friend at least."</p>

<p>"Thank God, for that."</p>

<p>"But it is necessary that we should make one agreement&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"That we shall not fall in love with each other."</p>

<p>"Oh, there is no danger!"</p>

<p>"Ah! who can be sure of that? You possess beauties
beyond your personal charms, Miss Nanna, that may conquer
me in spite of myself."</p>

<p>"You are also beautiful; but I do not believe that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You do not believe that you would ever fall in love
with me, you were about saying. Upon my word that is so
much the better, for to speak truly I am placed in as
bad circumstances as you are yourself."</p>

<p>"You are!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I speak the truth. My only ambition is to
become an assistant in my father's office."</p>

<p>"If that is the case," said Nanna, "you must fall in love
with a rich girl only."</p>

<p>"I shall be careful of my own interests I assure you,"
replied Gottlieb, "but now this perplexing point is rightly
settled&mdash;is it not?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>"Yes, you are to marry a wealthy girl, and I am to
keep a school, is that the agreement?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and now we must make another arrangement, which is
that we must agree to meet each other during the
evening hours at this spot. I own many books that
will be useful to you, and if you can sing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can sing a little, and the old sexton says my voice is
beautiful."</p>

<p>"Allow me to hear you sing."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, I cannot this evening."</p>

<p>"O, you should not refuse a friend in that manner.
It would be quite different if I was your lover."</p>

<p>Without further words, Nanna commenced singing an
old ballad, and her sweet voice, as she trilled forth the
beautiful words of her song, fell upon the ear of her young
companion like the soft music of a bird.</p>

<p>"You sing excellently, Nanna, and I think your voice
would be improved if you could play upon the guitar. I
have one at home, and might bring it with me."</p>

<p>"But the guitar would not benefit my future pupils."</p>

<p>"It will serve for your amusement after your scholars
have left you in the afternoon. You will find such a
relaxation quite necessary, and when you play upon it,
and sing one of your beautiful ballads, you will think of
your friend."</p>

<p>"And drive away the tedium of the long hours.&mdash;O,
sir, you are too kind!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>"Stop, Nanna! Call me Gottlieb, not sir. You know
friends should&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks, Sir Gottlieb! What a beautiful name! But
it is quite late!"</p>

<p>Nanna, who was fearful that Magde, anxious at her long
absence, would come in search of her, arose from her seat
upon the grass, and hastily departed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Chase.</span></h3>


<p>The next morning, a few hours before Carl, whistling
a ballad of which he was the author, commenced his journey
over ditches and stiles, to fulfill his engagement to watch
with the children of the peasant woman, Mr. Fabian
H&mdash;&mdash; was awakened by his affectionate wife, who informed
him that it was time for him to prepare himself for his
hunting expedition.</p>

<p>Sleepy, and unwilling to leave his cozy bed, for the sake
of enjoying the damp morning air, Mr. Fabian addressed
his spouse with all the tenderness which his state of mind
would permit:</p>

<p><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>"Dear Ulgenie, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mistress Ulrica, however, did not permit herself to
be moved by this gentle epithet.</p>

<p>"Fabian," said she, shaking his shoulder roughly, "you
are going to sleep again. Quick! get up! I have had
your top boots nicely greased, and on the chair you will
find your hunting coat and game-bag. Everything is made
as comfortable as possible."</p>

<p>"Sweet Ulgenie," expostulated Mr. Fabian.</p>

<p>The amiable lady smiled as she heard him speak, and
had not an unfortunate yawn accompanied those two tender
words, in all probability they would have terminated
this chapter. But the word yawn is not found in Love's
dictionary, and consequently the unlucky husband was
forced to rise from his bed preparatory to going forth to
perform deeds of valor in obedience to the commands of
his mistress.</p>

<p>"Do not neglect to awaken Gottlieb. He also must
learn the noble art of hunting."</p>

<p>"I will, my dear, I will," said her husband, perspiring
with his exertions, as he forced himself into his hunting
garments which Mistress Ulrica had made from a pattern
of her own invention. But when Mr. Fabian had completed
his toilette, he hastened from the house, intentionally
forgetting to awaken Gottlieb, for, as we shall soon
discover, he had urgent reasons for wishing to perform his
hunting exploits without the hindrance of a companion.<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>
As Sir Fabian was, so to speak, his wife's butler, he
had provided himself with a deputy butler, who generally
received a hint of the day and the hour, when stern fate
would compel his master to encase his feet in heavy hunting
boots.</p>

<p>We now see this martyr to the holy cause of matrimony,
puffing and blowing beneath the weight of his heavy gun,
as he wends his way across the fields towards a certain spot
in the forest at which he finally arrives. He looks around
him with searching eyes; his brow is clouded with anxiety
and impatience. Suddenly his eyes gleam with an
expression of joy; but he instantly recovers himself and
assumes an air of dignified composure, while he gazes
angrily upon the form of a man, who is approaching him
through the trees.</p>

<p>"Fool! you have kept me waiting!" said he harshly as
the man advanced.</p>

<p>Humbly but with a humility which was more assumed
than natural, the "Butler," presented Mr. Fabian with
two hares, and two partridges; which would fill his game-bag
uncommonly well and ensure a loving welcome upon
his return home. After this ceremony was performed
Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; threw his accomplice a few pieces of silver, and
when the last named performer in this little scene had vanished,
our huntsman fatigued by his arduous exertions
cast himself upon a moss-covered bank and was soon continuing
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>the dream which had been so unpleasantly interrupted
by his sweet Ulgenie.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the woods, near the sea I have lived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Many a day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Ho, ho, ho,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;Ha, ha, ha,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;It is so lovely on the earth!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus sang or hummed Carl as he proceeded on his way.</p>

<p>Suddenly he experienced a strong desire to rush into
the woods to listen to the sighing of the wind as it
swept through the high branches of the trees. In this
music Carl took such delight that he would listen to it, for
hours, while great tears of pleasure and excitement would
roll down his sun-burnt cheeks. But it was the pleasure
and excitement of a religious enthusiast in the house of the
God he worshipped. Carl never spoke of these sentiments,
and how would it have been possible for him to do so.
He never thought from whence they originated. He followed
his inclination only.</p>

<p>While Carl was thus engaged he suddenly saw an object
which caused him instantly to neglect the sound of his
favorite music. In the grass near the fence over which
Carl was about climbing, he saw the slumbering huntsman,
with the freshly killed game reposing at his side.</p>

<p>Carl, without knowing why, had conceived the idea
that Magde disliked Mr. Fabian H&mdash;&mdash;, and as for himself,
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>he instinctively hated that worthy gentleman. And
another thought entered his head as he looked upon the
game. He remembered that Magde had once said: "Ah!
had we but a hare or a partridge, how delicious it would
be! But such things are too good for us, they must be
sent to the manor house."</p>

<p>Carl laughed silently. He extended his hand towards
the sleeping man, and then withdrew it undecidedly. Our
friend Carl possessed a few indistinct ideas concerning the
law of <i>meum and teum</i>. By dint of great exertion, his
father had implanted in his mind the great necessity of
observing the eighth commandment, and upon the present
occasion the lesson of his younger days interfered in a
great degree with the accomplishment of his present designs;
for as he gazed upon the objects of his envy, he
muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"<i>The Eighth Commandment:</i> Thou shalt not steal!"</p>

<p>His brain was not only troubled with the eighth, but the
words of the tenth commandment came to his memory,
"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his servant,
nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass."</p>

<p>As he thus spoke, and thought first of the commandments
and then of Magde, he continued to advance and
retreat, wavering in his decision, and he might have remained
in this state until Mr. Fabian awoke, had not a
bright idea forced itself upon his mind.</p>

<p>"O," exclaimed he, "the commandments say nothing
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>about <i>game</i>!" and as even the veriest simpleton has it in his
power to convince himself of the purity of an action, however
wrong, Carl soon satisfied himself with the excuse
which he had so ingeniously invented. He entirely forgot
the closing line of the commandment, "nor anything that
is his," which, however, would not bear consideration on
that occasion. He therefore seized the two hares that were
nearest him, and by the assistance of a long stick he
gained possession of the partridges also.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Fabian's assistant, who had not
yet left the forest, having been attracted by Carl's movements,
had been an eye-witness to his proceedings. But
instead of warning the lad of his crime, the spectator
seemed rather to rejoice at his patron's misfortune. He
might safely do this, for after the crime had been committed,
he could easily disclose the name of the thief, and
thus avert suspicion from himself. He thought that Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; would not injure a person of Carl's character, and
that at all events he would be likely to receive a proper
reward for any zeal he should exert to promote the interest
of his employer. Carl had discovered that his actions had
been observed; but as the spectator, by sundry winks and
nods, seemed rather to encourage than to prevent him,
Carl proceeded without fear.</p>

<p>And now, having won the victory, he hastened to
Magde.</p>

<p>But here trouble awaited him.</p>

<p><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>When Carl presented Magde the game, she was delighted;
but after her outburst of admiration had subsided,
her first question naturally was as to where he
had procured his prize.</p>

<p>"Is it not enough that it is here?" said Carl, as he stood
on the threshold, twirling his hat in his hand.</p>

<p>"Heavens! I trust you have not procured it in an
unlawful way?"</p>

<p>"No, I got it while going the right way," replied Carl,
mischievously.</p>

<p>"My dear Carl," said Magde, seriously, "you must not
think to deceive me by your cunning words."</p>

<p>"You should not say so," answered Carl, sulkily.</p>

<p>"No, I should not, Carl, I spoke foolishly; but if you
are a good boy, and love me, you will tell me who has
given you this game, or whether you have promised to pay
for it by working by-and-bye."</p>

<p>"I have already worked for it," said Carl, with a laugh,
"but I must go now, or else I will be too late at Sunnangaarden."</p>

<p>Thus saying, Carl was about putting his long legs in
active motion, when Magde exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Carl! Carl! a word more! stop, Carl!"</p>

<p>"I have staid too long already," said Carl; but still he
remained.</p>

<p>"Tell me frankly, Carl, did you procure the game honestly?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>Carl, who rested upon the tenth commandment, in which
neither hares nor partridges were mentioned, answered
shrewdly:</p>

<p>"If you doubt my honor, I will refer you to the catechism.
Do you believe in the catechism?"</p>

<p>"Is it true then that you have done nothing contrary to
its precepts?"</p>

<p>"It is indeed true," replied Carl, gravely.</p>

<p>"Then I am satisfied," said Magde, "and I am grateful
to you, my good Carl, for the welcome present."</p>

<p>"Good? Yes, can I really believe you, Magde?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I so consider you, and therefore I am good to
you."</p>

<p>Carl commenced laughing, and assumed a crane-like
position, as he balanced himself upon one leg. This was
his usual custom when pleased.</p>

<p>"Well, well, then you love poor Carl a little. That's
good!"</p>

<p>"Carl is my good boy," replied Magde, who during the
conversation had been engaged in spreading out a number
of skeins of knitting yarn that had been placed out to
bleach upon the grass plot.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Carl, approaching nigher to Magde,
"would Magde shed a tear upon my grave if God should
call me from earth?"</p>

<p>There reposed in these words a tone of mingled fear and
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>humility, and Magde, much moved by the peculiar
expression of Carl's countenance, replied:</p>

<p>"Certainly, Carl, I would shed many, many tears, for I
believe there are none who love you as I do."</p>

<p>"I am grateful, Magde," said Carl, violently scraping
the ground with the sole of his hob-nailed shoe, an action
which could scarcely be called a bow&mdash;"your words shall
be remembered. I am Magde's servant, and shall be so
as long as I live."</p>

<p>With these words, he turned on his heel, and trotted
towards his place of destination.</p>

<p>"The poor lad has a good heart," thought Magde, as
she concluded her labors in the yard; but she little imagined
the true state of Carl's heart.</p>

<p>Magde now entered the house to prepare breakfast.
Her three children crowded around her, loudly testifying
their admiration of the partridges and hares. She commenced
dressing the game with that placidity of countenance,
and with that dexterity which proved she was well
versed in that most important branch of a housekeeper's
duties&mdash;cookery.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Concerning the Hunter in the Woods,
and his homeward walk.</span></h3>


<p>We now return to our friend the sportsman, who soon
awoke from his sound slumber, quite refreshed. He
yawned, stretched himself, and mechanically extended his
hand towards the spot where he had placed his game-bag.</p>

<p>Although his hand touched nothing but the grass and
his gun, he nevertheless was not troubled, for he thought
that he had miscalculated the distance. He searched still
further; but to his surprise the game-bag was still missing.
He now raised himself up in a sitting posture, and rubbing
his eyes vigorously, he searched the ground closely. But
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>his eyes, usually so good, must have been dimmed by some
enchantment, for he could perceive neither the hares nor
the partridges, which he could not but think were there.</p>

<p>Determined, however, not to believe in such marvels,
for honest Fabian was a man of intelligence, he arose and
peered through the bushes in the grass; he looked in
the air, and he closely scanned the tops of the trees; but
his efforts were fruitless. The game was not to be found.</p>

<p>"It is astonishing!" said he to himself. "I can not believe
it! They must be here! But where the devil are
they then!"</p>

<p>The trees retained a stubborn silence, and their example
was followed by the earth, the air, and the water. Although
the heat of the day was rendered still more insufferable
by Mr. Fabian's thick hunting suit, yet his flesh
chilled with fear when he discovered the actual loss of his
partridges and hares.</p>

<p>To return home without his game, was a misfortune,
which under ordinary circumstances he could have endured;
but on this occasion he had reason to expect a more
than usually severe lecture from his wife whose command
he had stubbornly disobeyed by not awakening Gottlieb.
While the unfortunate sportsman was bewailing his fate
he discovered the face of his "butler," who was peering
out from between the bushes with an expression of mingled
humility and mirthfulness.</p>

<p><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>"Where are my partridges, you rascal?" shouted Mr.
Fabian, his face glowing with anger.</p>

<p>"Do you think, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, that I have taken them?"</p>

<p>"Such a jest would be but natural. What are you
doing here? Have I not paid you enough?"</p>

<p>"I never do anything without orders, and if you do
not wish me to remain, I will go instantly. I thought,
however, that you would be pleased if I should tell you
what had become of your game."</p>

<p>"That is just what I wish to know! Has any one presumed
to steal it?"</p>

<p>"Very likely."</p>

<p>"Who? Quick! Tell me!"</p>

<p>But the butler answered only with a long drawn.
"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Can you substantiate what you are about to say?"</p>

<p>"I can swear to it, if it is necessary. I waited here
only that I might be able to explain everything to my employer,
after he should awake."</p>

<p>"You are a fine fellow, now tell me what evil being has
entered the woods, and committed this depredation?"</p>

<p>"If you wish to have a full account of the matter, you
should tender full payment," said the butler, who considered
this play of words exceedingly apt and forcible.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I will not be ungenerous," replied Mr. Fabian
taking a bank-note from his pocket.</p>

<p><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>"Carl,&mdash;the fool of the valley&mdash;purloined the hares and
partridges."</p>

<p>"What! that cur!&mdash;the son of old Lonner!"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>"Are you certain?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as certain as I am that I live."</p>

<p>"Good," said Mr. Fabian, and he repeated the same
word several times, each time appearing better satisfied,
and certainly the thoughts that occupied his mind must
have afforded him great pleasure, for he not only forgot
the trouble that awaited his return home, but also the
question, which in truth should have been the first one&mdash;why
the Butler had not stopped the thief and rescued the
booty. The Butler, however, thought it expedient not
to await further questions, and therefore soon found an
opportunity of retreating.</p>

<p>Our readers may be assured that when the sportsman
returned home his wife was not in the best of humor.
She awaited his coming in the parlor; but when she heard
his footsteps in the court-yard, she could no longer restrain
her impatience, but hastened to the window and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Where were your silly thoughts wandering, when you
left the house without calling Gottlieb. I must say that
you conduct yourself friendly towards <i>my</i> relations, and I
do think it is equally astonishing that you have come home
without him. I sent him to look for you a long time ago.<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>
What! can I believe my eyes! Where is the game that
I was to have for dinner?"</p>

<p>"Dear Ulrique Eugenie, can you not wait until I have
changed my clothes? I have travelled so far through
the woods, that I can scarcely breathe, I am so weary."</p>

<p>"Where is the game?"</p>

<p>"Whew!" ejaculated her husband, "I can stand these
clothes no longer." Thus saying, he hastened into the
house, and proceeded to his apartment.</p>

<p>But this respite was of short duration. Mistress Ulrica
Eugenie was familiar with the road to the chamber, and
her rage reached its highest point, when she heard that
the game which was intended for her dinner, had been
stolen while her husband, overcome by his arduous exertions,
had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>"O, if I only knew who did this, yes, if I only knew, I
would have the rascal put in the stocks. But you, you
dormouse, yes you, you call yourself a man! you! Don't
you wish to borrow my petticoat! To sleep when engaged
in the noble art of hunting! To complain of fatigue!
Fie upon such men! But can you not discover the thief?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear, I assure you. I cannot, how could I
know what happened while I was sleeping?"</p>

<p>"That is the reason why you never knew anything in
your life," replied the exasperated woman. "But see there
comes Gottlieb with a partridge in his hand. He is a pattern.
<i>He</i> never allows <i>his</i> game to be stolen," and Mistress<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>
Ulrica composed her features, and assumed an expression
of motherly benevolence, while she descended the
stairs to receive her nephew.</p>

<p>"Thank you, good Gottlieb," said she meeting him at
the door, "thank you, your uncle has been unfortunate
this morning; but come with me to the dairy, and you shall
have the cream of an entire pan of milk."</p>

<p>"The milk also, if you please, aunty, I feel myself able
to devour every thing, pan and all."</p>

<p>"Well, satisfy yourself. By and by we will go to my
bleachery and you may select a piece of linen.&mdash;Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Not a word. It is all a mystery. But I do know that
there is not a nephew on the entire Scandinavian peninsula,
who possesses an aunt with such an affectionate disposition."</p>

<p>"Ah, you flatterer, it is well that you are my nephew
or else Fabian might be jealous."</p>

<p>"Well I am not sure but that he may yet have an occasion,
for, I am not aware that nephews are forbidden to
love their aunts."</p>

<p>From that day forward Gottlieb was taken under the
especial protection of his aunt, and as her favorite he was
certain of a comfortable and pleasant life. When she became
acquainted with his manners, virtues and accomplishments,
her esteem for him was, if possible, doubly increased.</p>

<p><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>What could he not do, the dear boy? Not to speak
of his wonderful success in amusing little Jean Ulrick, Mr.
Fabian's sole heir, he was able to read aloud to his aunt
from her favorite volume, and to repeat with almost sublime
patience, all those tender passages to which she in a plaintive
tone would sigh <i>de capo</i>. More than all this. He could
sing&mdash;the model nephew&mdash;and accompany his voice with the
guitar not only to the tune of "my love and I," but also
to his aunt's favorite ballad, "In the shadows of the wood;
in the cavern hid away." And finally there was not a
female domestic in the house who dared to compete with
Gottlieb in the art of chopping string beans. In short, he
was a nephew whose peer could not be found in all Sweden,
and who knows whether the piece of linen he chose from
the bleachery was the last he received from his indulgent
aunt.</p>

<p>Poor Gottlieb, while you are thus the prime favorite of
your strong minded aunt, having free access to the pantries
and dairy-rooms, have you no misgivings that the day will
arrive when the doors of this house shall be closed
against you? Relentless fate who ever demands a sacrifice.
How true are the words of the wise Solomon, "All is
vanity and vexation of spirit; and there is no profit under
the sun." But it is not to be believed that Mr. Fabian's
slumbers were disturbed because his wife had deserted him.
No, he even preferred the company of hunger and thirst
rather than that of his Ulgenie. Not that this state of mind
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>originated from the many lectures he had received from
his wife. Ah, no, there were far more powerful reasons;
but it is certain that if Mistress Ulrica had suspected that
her husband's indifference arose from any other motive
than the wish to escape a deserved punishment she would
have, undoubtedly, increased the vigor of her tongue to
such a pitch that his house would have been uncomfortably
warm to him.</p>

<p>After dining upon Gottlieb's partridge which had done
much to smoothe her ruffled temper, Mrs. Ulrica was thus
insinuatingly addressed by her husband:</p>

<p>"Have you any errands for me to perform at the parsonage,
dear Ulgenie? I wish to ride down there to talk over
the parish matters with the parson."</p>

<p>"That's right, dear Fabian. Take Gottlieb along
with you. He would like to see the young ladies, each of
whom are worth a ton of gold."</p>

<p>At this proposal Mr. Fabian's brow darkened; but the
gloom was soon dispelled as Gottlieb declined the pleasure
of going, and the first smile which the young man had
received from his uncle was when he replied: "Excuse me
to-day, my dear aunt, I wish to write to my mother."</p>

<p>He had no desire to disappoint his young pupil of the
valley.</p>

<p>"Excellent youth!" exclaimed his aunt, "pleasure cannot
wile you from your duties. God forbid that I should
attempt to do so; and you Fabian," she added extending
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>her arms towards her husband, "kiss me before you go.
Your Ulgenie has no desire to deprive you of any reasonable
enjoyments."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mr. Fabian and Magde Lonner.</span></h3>


<p>"O, how thankful I am that you can come out here on
the green, dear father." Thus said Magde, as she gave
old Mr. Lonner his hat and cane, after Nanna had filled
and lighted his pipe.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful scene to behold the two sisters thus
employed. Ragnar was right. Without waiting for a
request, they were apparently striving to outvie each other
in performing little services for the old man. In short, Mr.
Lonner had not a wish which was not gratified. They
anticipated his every desire.</p>

<p><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>"There, that will do, my daughters; I thank you. I feel
so young to-day, that I am quite happy. My rheumatism
has left me almost entirely; so give me your arm, Nanna,
and we will go."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" inquired Magde.</p>

<p>"O, after we have taken a short walk," replied Nanna,
"I have proposed that we should go to the spring in the
meadow, and sit down awhile. It used to be one of papa's
favorite spots."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better take a book with you," said
Magde, "and then you can read to him."</p>

<p>Nanna blushed. Her object was to afford to her father
another and much greater pleasure. She hoped in this
manner to introduce Gottlieb to him before the youth
should visit the cottage, because she feared that Magde in
that case would wonder at her familiarity with the new
comer.</p>

<p>Many times during the day, Nanna had endeavored to
say to Magde, "last evening, and the evening before, I
met an elegant young man near the spring in the meadow;"
but for some unknown reason, the words never passed
over her lips. She imagined that if she was alone with
her father, she would not fear to tell him, and she also
thought that when Gottlieb would see her with the old
man, he would know that she had not agreed to meet him
alone.</p>

<p>Her father would also converse with them about the
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>time when she should commence her school, about which
she had already erected many castles in the air. A little
house she had thought should be erected in the valley.
Here she should dwell alone with her cat, her little goldfinch
with his elegant green cage, and she would also have
a shed for her cow. She also wished to take a dog with
her; but finally she thought she would not do so, for he
would eat too much, and aside from that, would not be of
the slightest benefit to her, for Carl would certainly assume
the entire control of him.</p>

<p>There was no doubt, she had thought, but that good Carl
would help her with her heavy work. That is, he would
come to her little house on Wednesday and Sunday afternoons,
to scrub her floors and bring the wood, while she
was engaged in making cakes and pies for her father and
Magde, who should visit her on those evenings. Of course
this plan was to be followed during the summer only. During
the winter, she would spend those afternoons and evenings
in the large house.</p>

<p>What true happiness did the girl experience as she thus
innocently dreamed of her future life! Her joy was increased
as she fancied herself seated in her little school-room
after the close of her labors for the day. That little
room was to be a bright place in her memory forever for was
it not he, her friend, who had told her that she would
require some recreation after school hours, and was he not
also to teach her the means for doing so?</p>

<p><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>We will not describe Nanna's blushing confusion as she
told her father of her acquaintance with Gottlieb, neither
will we paint at length, the mingled sentiments of fear and
hope which filled the old man's heart as he heard his
daughter's story; but will simply remark that the meeting
between old Mr. Lonner and Gottlieb was mutually
gratifying, and that as is naturally the case under such
circumstances, they each wished to continue the acquaintance
thus pleasingly commenced.</p>

<p>Upon the sand in front of the cottage Magde's children
were playing in the sun, while Christine, the servant girl,
was dividing her attention between her sewing work, and
the baby which was reposing in a kneading trough, upon
a little bed of rushes. She would also occasionally cast her
eyes towards the other children, as they dug little ditches
which they filled with water brought from the house in an
old kettle, and then sailed their little bark boats in these
miniature canals.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Magde, as usual, was sitting in the
parlor, weaving at her loom with such violence that the
window panes rattled in their sashes. As she was thus
engaged she hummed a little song, which Ragnar during
their courtship had frequently sung beneath her window
as a signal that he wished to see her alone. As Magde
loved her husband above all other earthly things, his
favorite song had never become discordant to her. This
song she took most pleasure in singing when she was alone,
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>for then she could give full rein to her fancy, and look forward
to the time when her loved husband should become
a captain, and command an elegant schooner in which he
could receive his wife, for she hoped that she might be able
to take one voyage at least to Goteborg, to preside at the
table in Captain Ragnar's cabin.</p>

<p>Then thought she, what a great stir her appearance in
the vessel would create! "Heavens," one would say,
"what a beautiful wife our captain has!" Yes, the captain
is a man of taste. "The captain, always the captain. O,
how grand it sounded! The captain loves her so much,"
the sailors would also say, "that he scarcely takes his eyes
from her, and how affectionately she looks at him! O, it
must be a happy life, to be thus married!"</p>

<p>While Magde was thus engaged in her pleasant reveries,
the latch was lifted and the door swung open slowly.</p>

<p>"Mercy! What can be Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;'s business here!"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"O, do not disturb yourself," said Mr. Fabian, for it
was our valorous huntsman who thus disturbed Magde's
dreams, "I hope everything may be arranged without
trouble. I am not the man who would injure his neighbor,
even if I had it in my power."</p>

<p>"What do you mean!" exclaimed Magde dropping her
shuttle in her terror.</p>

<p>In the meantime the worthy gentleman had gradually
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>approached Magde, but so softly and cautiously that he
resembled a cat about pouncing upon a trembling mouse.</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid," replied Mr. Fabian, "that I should
think that you knew anything about it. A woman so virtuous
as you are, would not engage in any wrong action;
but I do think that a man's property should be respected."</p>

<p>"Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, if you have any evil tidings speak them
out at once. Perhaps Jon Jonson has arrived, and the
goods that Ragnar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With a deep blush Magde suddenly ceased speaking;
but her visitor required nothing further. He pretended,
however, not to have understood her words; but as he
well knew that Jon Jonson's vessel was still at Goteborg
for he expected some merchandise in it himself, it did not
require much penetration for him to surmise that the mate
Lonner had taken an opportunity of sending home some
smuggled goods by his friend Jonson.</p>

<p>"I know nothing about Jon Jonson's vessel," said Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; after a moment's pause, "but, I can readily
perceive that you expect some compliments from your
husband."</p>

<p>"Yes, not only compliments; but also a quantity of
merchandise," replied Magde, who, after a moment's reflection
had concluded that it was better not to make a
secret of it, "as Ragnar had a little overplus he concluded
to send us a few necessary articles from Goteborg.<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>
We are poor, and cannot demand credit until he returns."</p>

<p>"It is better not to do so," replied her visitor, "but at
present we have neither Jon Jonson nor Ragnar to speak
about. A certain person in this neighborhood has placed
himself in an unpleasant position."</p>

<p>"Who can it be?" exclaimed Magde, terrified by Mr.
Fabian's imposing aspect, "I will run and call father!"</p>

<p>"If the old man is not at home," replied her visitor
concealing his joy by assuming a frown of vexation, "it
will be better not to call him as it will only cause the venerable
man much pain."</p>

<p>"Tell me, do tell me, what has been done?" stammered
the frightened woman.</p>

<p>"I refer to your brother Carl!"</p>

<p>"Carl, the half-witted Carl."</p>

<p>"O, he is in no want of wit, and his weak mind shall
not serve him as a protection when he stands before the
justice. Theft is theft, no matter who commits it. At
least so the law considers it."</p>

<p>"The game!" cried Magde clasping her hands in despair
and terror.</p>

<p>"You are right, the game that he stole from me this
morning while I was sleeping. I knew full well that the
proud and conscientious Magde, would not deny that he
had brought it home."</p>

<p>"But who could have&mdash;have&mdash;"</p>

<p><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>"Right, who could have believed that he would have
done so, and that is the very point, and an unlucky one,
for it proves that he must have been seen while committing
the theft."</p>

<p>"How terrible this is! A few days ago I happened to
say that I wished we had some game for our old father,
and now&mdash;now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Calm yourself," interrupted Mr. Fabian, extending
his hand and enforcing his consolation by a love-tap upon
Magde's shoulder. In her affliction Magde did not withdraw
from this salute, and Mr. Fabian had an opportunity of
gazing upon her lovely neck for a full moment, to prolong
which he would have given the value of a hundred hares
and partridges. But Magde arousing herself from her
stupor, looked her guest full in the face, and there read
an expression which displeased her.</p>

<p>With a blush she replaced the handkerchief around her
neck, and suddenly enquired:</p>

<p>"What then, sir, is the real intention of your visit?
You said you would not disturb us, and as the game is
untouched we can return it immediately."</p>

<p>"The game is not the object of my visit."</p>

<p>"What is then?"</p>

<p>"The theft. Carl will be brought before the justice, I
told you there was a witness to his crime."</p>

<p>"But how can that happen unless you enter a complaint?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>"Have I not the right to enforce the law which is made
to protect our property? but it is possible that I might
hush the matter up if I chose; and when I fancy that I
see the poor fellow under arrest, when I behold him in
the culprit's box, in the court-room; when I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"May God protect him!" interrupted Magde, "you
have said enough, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;. I am but the wife of a poor
sailor; but if my humble prayers will be of the least avail&mdash;"
and Magde, the proud Magde, who before had often dismissed
Mr. Fabian with disdainful gestures, now clasped
her hands, and looked into his face with an expression of
tearful entreaty.</p>

<p>"O, do not despair, my dear Magde," said he, "such
tender prayers and looks, have a wonderful influence
upon me. Aside from that your present attitude is perfectly
charming."</p>

<p>Overpowered by a sudden revulsion of feelings, Magde
closed her eyes, and sank her head upon her bosom.</p>

<p>"I see," said she, "that you do not intend to assist us
from our present trouble."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," replied Mr. Fabian with much animation,
"I will do everything for you, if you will only
conduct yourself towards me, in a manner different from
that which you have done heretofore."</p>

<p>"If Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; demands nothing more than friendship,"
replied Magde, with difficulty repressing her anger, "that
shall not be wanting."</p>

<p><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>"Nothing more, upon my honor," said Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, joyfully,
"if you, dear Magde, will promise that when you
meet me you will favor me with a look of kindness, I
assure you by my honor, that nothing more shall be heard
about this unpleasant affair; and as a proof that we shall
hereafter be friends, I demand the slight favor of a kiss."</p>

<p>"That cannot be," replied Magde, with the coolness of
despair, "I love Carl as my brother, and will give anything
to preserve him from disgrace, except that which does not
belong to me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, my little piece of stubbornness, do
not your lips belong to yourself?"</p>

<p>"From the moment that I entered my bridal chamber,
I considered myself as belonging to my husband alone,
and Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, you can be assured that you are not
the person who can cause me to forget my husband's
rights."</p>

<p>"Look you," shouted a harsh voice from the door, "before
Magde should kiss your wrinkled old lips, I would
run into the prison of my own accord;" and first Carl's
head, and then his uncouth form appeared, as he entered
the room. His face was convulsed with passion, and his
eyes glanced irefully upon the surprised Fabian.</p>

<p>"Simpleton! you trespass upon my good nature!"
exclaimed Mr. Fabian, foaming with rage.</p>

<p>"Do I?" replied Carl, "perhaps I shall trespass upon
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>something else. Do you know, sir, what I shall say when
the justice questions me?"</p>

<p>"What would you say, good Carl?" inquired Magde,
encouragingly.</p>

<p>"I would say, for I know exactly how it will come to
pass, I would humbly say to the justice, that I did take
the hares and partridges from the proprietor of Almvik."</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Mr. Fabian, "you will be obliged to
show your hand."</p>

<p>"'Now,' the judge will reply," continued Carl, without
noticing the interruption, "'My lad, why did you do so?'
Then I will answer, because it is not forbidden in my
catechism; if the game had been an ox or an ass, I would
not have taken it. Then I would say to the justice, at the
same time looking at him in this way"&mdash;and Carl made
such a ridiculous grimace that Magde nearly laughed outright&mdash;"that
there was no danger that Mr. Fabian H&mdash;&mdash; would
frighten such fierce animals as the ox and the ass,
for it is his custom to charm the hares and partridges by
the sweet sound of his snores, for your Honor must know
that this huntsman pursues his game while comfortably
snoring in the grass."</p>

<p>"What do you say, clown?"</p>

<p>"And then I can call as a witness the very man whom
you intend to use against me, and finally I think that the
justice will smile a little when I tell him that Mr. Fabian<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>
H&mdash;&mdash; was willing to forget all harsh measures for a kiss
from Magde."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" exclaimed Mr. Fabian, with a forced
laugh, with which he attempted to conceal his uneasiness,
"you are a waggish rogue! Your last words have
afforded me so much amusement that I have not the heart
to injure you for such a trifle. But listen, you little simpleton;
you must not suppose that the justice would allow
you to say all that. No, he would have sent you away
long before you could have had time to utter a word
about it."</p>

<p>Carl made no further reply than by applying his thumb
to his nasal organ; and gyrating his fingers in a manner
so significant that we will not endeavor to interpret his
meaning. Having executed this manoeuver, he hastily left
the room, but remained at such a distance that he could
keep a watchful eye through the open door upon the unwelcome
guest.</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian, who did not wish to appear vanquished, was
at a loss how to change the conversation to such a theme
as would afford him a suitable opportunity to take his
leave in a dignified manner. But good Magde, who had
now entirely recovered her usual equanimity, soon assisted
him&mdash;by means of that instinct which sometimes puts
superior knowledge to the blush&mdash;out of his dilemma by
saying:</p>

<p><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>"I am grateful to you, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, for having forgiven
Carl because his words amused you; but what a simpleton
the boy is!"</p>

<p>"It was because he was a simpleton that I forgave him;
but now as my visit is at an end, I will release you from
your unwelcome guest. As for the game, Carl can keep
it. It would at all events create suspicion if it was sent to
Almvik."</p>

<p>"And you, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, you will not be angry with us?"</p>

<p>"I, God forbid. When I forgive I forget everything."</p>

<p>Magde arose and courtesied as her visitor took his departure.
She accompanied him a short distance from the
house, and waited till he unfastened the horse's halter.</p>

<p>After mounting his animal, he drove his horse near the
spot where Magde was standing, and as he passed her he
bowed deeply, but his face wore an expression that caused
her entire form to tremble with an undefined fear.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Truant.</span></h3>


<p>Fourteen days elapsed. Gottlieb had fully learned the
road from Almvik to the cottage in the valley. It had
never entered the mind of any one of the inmates of the
cottage to consider him a dangerous guest. Magde, who
possessed a quick eye, soon discovered that Nanna was the
cause of his visits; but she also perceived that Gottlieb
was no dissembler. Magde did not look further than this,
for she did not suppose Nanna would ever love one who
did not return her affection. Unrequited love she did not
believe in, and she thought that Nanna was of her opinion
in this respect.</p>

<p><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>And in truth thus it appeared, for neither Nanna nor
Gottlieb experienced the slightest degree of restraint when
in each other's society. The change that had taken place
in Nanna's appearance was marvellous; the blossoms of
buoyant and happy girlhood had usurped the place formerly
occupied by lilies on her cheeks, and our young hero
had more than once laughingly said:</p>

<p>"It is fortunate, Miss Nanna, that we made our agreement
when we first met, for if we had not I do not know
what would have happened. You become lovelier every
day, Nanna."</p>

<p>Yet in spite of these words Gottlieb would blush with
displeasure when their meetings at the spring were disturbed
by a third person.</p>

<p>The youthful teacher and pupil continued their meetings
at the little fountain, and Gottlieb at this spot gave Nanna
her first instructions upon the guitar. To his great pleasure
she learned quickly, and soon she was able to sing her
beautiful songs to her own accompaniment on his favorite
instrument.</p>

<p>Words are inadequate to describe Gottlieb's pride and
elation when this was accomplished, and he was none the
less rejoiced when he discovered how readily Nanna comprehended
him when he read to her the writings of his
favorite bards.</p>

<p>On her part Nanna replied to her kind teacher, by confiding
to him all of her little plans, among the first of
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>which she mentioned the school-room, the cat and the singing
bird which he was to have, and Gottlieb gave her his
advice concerning the arrangement of the benches in the
school-room; the position which the black-board should
occupy, and what little presents she should make her
pupils as rewards of merit. He concluded by promising
to send her every year a letter of advice; possibly he
might come himself, occasionally, who knew?</p>

<p>"I am sure of that," said Nanna, one afternoon in reply
to Gottlieb, as he thus expressed himself, "for when
you are married you will be obliged to visit Almvik
to show your rich wife to your uncle and aunt."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied Gottlieb, with a laugh, "that journey
will not be necessary, for if my aunt could only have her own
way, she would certainly find me a wife in this neighborhood."</p>

<p>"Who could you possibly marry in this neighborhood?"
inquired Nanna curiously.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mademoiselle Nanna," replied Gottlieb, "I
easily perceive that you are not in the least danger, for
you can hear that your friend Gottlieb is to be married
and betray not the slightest emotion."</p>

<p>"Why should I be moved, Mr. Gottlieb? It will have
to occur sometime," said Nanna innocently.</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What yet!"</p>

<p>"You are a good girl."</p>

<p><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>"Ah, but don't you remember the agreement?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I only intended to remark that it would not
be difficult for you to adhere to it."</p>

<p>"Does that displease you, sir?" inquired Nanna in a
tone of displeasure which was the more pertinent as it was
foreign to her usual manner.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Miss Nanna, on the contrary I am
delighted that you should follow my advice so faithfully&mdash;either
of the young ladies at the parsonage are suitable."</p>

<p>"Did you refer to one of those?" inquired Nanna, her
countenance assuming a deathly paleness, "O they are so
beautiful."</p>

<p>"Yes, perfectly angelic&mdash;especially Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;what
is her name?"</p>

<p>"You probably allude to Miss Charlotte."</p>

<p>"Right, Miss Charlotte, whose hair is so black and
beautiful."</p>

<p>"O, no, that is Sophia!" exclaimed Nanna.</p>

<p>"Well then, Miss Sophia, I prefer her."</p>

<p>"But why is it that you changed their names?" inquired
Nanna.</p>

<p>"Why, you heard that I did not confound her black
hair with her sister's brown ringlets."</p>

<p>"How strange! Charlotte's hair is quite light!"</p>

<p>"Of what earthly difference is it," replied Gottlieb,<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>
"whether Charlotte's hair is brown or white, I think only
of the roguish and pretty Miss Sophia."</p>

<p>"I think you are jesting with me, sir," said Nanna laughing
so heartily that the roses instantly returned to her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"I jest with you!"</p>

<p>"Of course. Miss Sophia is so serious and thoughtful
that no person would call her roguish."</p>

<p>"Were you not as quiet as an old prayer-book the first
time I saw you?" replied Gottlieb.</p>

<p>"And even if it was so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just look into the water, my little miss, and tell me
whether you look as you used to."</p>

<p>"Then you would say, Mr. Gottlieb, that by some magic
spell you have driven away Miss Sophia's gloominess?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can say Miss Sophia's also."</p>

<p>"<i>Also?</i>&mdash;that is a bold speech!"</p>

<p>"Are you angry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Gottlieb!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Nanna. Are you weeping?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Gottlieb may be mischievous and tantalizing
enough to compel me to do so; but this time he has not
succeeded."</p>

<p>"Well, as I cannot force you to weep, I must confess
the truth, and that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you have seen neither of them," interrupted
Nanna.</p>

<p><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>"Not that, there you are mistaken, for I called at the
parsonage one evening with my aunt, and I was so much
pleased with the young ladies, that now I am here with
you, while they are at Almvik, where they arrived this
morning. What do you think of that?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>What Nanna thought Gottlieb did not learn; but he
soon was made acquainted with his aunt Ulrica's opinion
concerning his absence. Gottlieb arrived at the latticed
gate of the court-yard at Almvik, just in time to salute
the young ladies from the parsonage as they drove forth
from the yard on their return home. They appeared
somewhat displeased, and returned Gottlieb's bow with a
stiff and cold salute.</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian observed with pleasure, the cloud which
shadowed the brow of his beloved Ulrica, foretelling the
storm that was to burst forth; but not on himself.</p>

<p>"Nephew Gottlieb," said Aunt Ulrica drawing the
young man aside, "you have to-day for the first time
afforded me an unpleasant surprise."</p>

<p>"In what manner, dear aunt," replied Gottlieb.</p>

<p>"Is it your custom when in your father's house to remain
away all day when young ladies are visiting your
parents?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>"Nothing would have been thought about it if such
had been the case. My mother is not overfond of such
strict principles of etiquette."</p>

<p>"That is to be regretted, for boys who have not been
carefully guided, rarely become gallant and well behaved
young men; but we will say no more on that subject."</p>

<p>"In that I concur."</p>

<p>"We will therefore confine ourselves to that subject to
which an innate knowledge guides us."</p>

<p>"That leads us back upon the same road."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, my young friend, if you will permit
me to follow my own course I will place you on the road
to heaven."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, my dear Aunt, that you have discovered
the right road?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, only think, a ton and a half of gold; beauty,
amiability, and a knowledge of cookery which excels that
of Miss Nylander<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> herself!"</p>

<p>"But love, my dear aunt, is that not to be found in
heaven?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, and it might have already made rapid progress
if you had assisted me in my first step towards the completion
of my designs, by remaining at home instead of running
away."</p>

<p>"Which proves that nothing existed before in which
love could take root."</p>

<p><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Mrs. Ulrica, "if you wish to
succeed your father you ought to improve your situation
by some good marriage. Miss Charlotte is a lovely blonde,
and Miss Sophia, a beautiful brunette, a perfect Spanish
donna."</p>

<p>"Yes, she has a remarkable resemblance to a donna;
but unfortunately I do not prefer Spanish ladies."</p>

<p>"Well, then Charlotte possesses an affectionate disposition.
You cannot but admire her fine sensitive nature,
which should kindle a love equalling Werther's love of
Lotta."</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I fear. How would I look
imitating Werther?"</p>

<p>"I do not wish you to follow his example. Charlotte
is a girl for whose sake a man might act foolishly, and
still be pardoned&mdash;then you prefer Charlotte?"</p>

<p>"No, above all things in the world I detest preferences."</p>

<p>"That is to say, you will cheerfully take the one of the
two sisters you most admire after you have had an opportunity
of visiting them a few weeks, and judging of their
good qualities for yourself."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, dear Aunt."</p>

<p>"Then, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That I have a great desire to look out for myself in
this matter; and that taking all things into consideration,
I am much too young to think of marriage."</p>

<p><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>"Then you despise your aunt's assistance?"</p>

<p>"God forbid that such a sentiment should ever enter
my heart. I honor and love God. I am grateful to Him
that He has given me a heart, and I pray Him not to
send me a bride which that heart cannot love."</p>

<p>"Your words sound well; but I shall not have my little
plot marred by them. Will you or will you not, accompany
me to the parsonage, and conduct yourself as
you should before the young ladies?"</p>

<p>"I will behave politely towards any young lady; but,
aunt, if you have any other meaning concealed beneath
those words then&mdash;I will say no!"</p>

<p>"You wish to quarrel with me, then. Do you understand
what that means, my dear nephew?"</p>

<p>"I dare not think of such a misfortune."</p>

<p>"Yet that misfortune will certainly come. God knows
I would do much for you; but consider upon your words
while you have yet time&mdash;you need not trouble yourself to
be present at the fishing excursion this evening."</p>

<p>"Why so, aunt, am I outlawed?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ulrica Eugenia assumed an air of haughtiness.</p>

<p>"Then I have fallen into disgrace," continued Gottlieb.</p>

<p>"I will not deny," replied Mistress Ulrica, coldly,
"that you are on the road to disgrace; but I hope this
wholesome lesson will cause you to think better of my exertions
in your behalf."</p>

<p>"Of that I have my doubts," thought Gottlieb as his
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>aunt majestically left the room; "and yet perhaps it is
foolish on my part not to take her advice.&mdash;Oh, why is
not my little nymph of the fountain the possessor of a ton
and a half of gold?&mdash;The little creature&mdash;hm&mdash;She
is really too beautiful!"</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Fisherman.</span></h3>


<p>The usually turbulent lake Wenner, presented, on the
evening of which we are about to write, an unruffled and
mirror-like appearance. In its clear bosom was reflected
the lofty cliffs of mount Kinnekulle, and sloop after sloop
passed over this gigantic image until a puffing steamboat
dashed over it and the picture was lost in the foaming
spray in her wake.</p>

<p>Almvik was situated on a truly romantic spot near the
margin of the lake, of which a magnificent view could be
obtained from the mansion. The surface of the lake this
evening presented a pleasing spectacle. Fishes were leaping
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>out of the water near little boats which were swinging
at anchor, or were being pulled by sturdy fishermen who
were going forth to ensnare the subjects of the water
Queen; but the proud Queen, who, from her crystal palace
beheld the danger, commanded her subjects to retreat, and
quickly the sportive fishes hastened to the depths of the
water that afforded them a barrier through which their
enemies could not break.</p>

<p>In consequence of these manoeuvers on the part of the
water Queen, our friend Mr. Fabian, who frequently endeavored
to capture her subjects, was invariably unsuccessful.
Undoubtedly this must have been a source of
much misery to the poor man, for he was situated between
two iron wills, namely that of his wife and that of the
water Queen; the latter would not pay tribute, while the
former demanded with all the firmness of an absolute
monarch, that the tribute should be forced from the water
Queen at all hazards.</p>

<p>After the above explanation our readers can well imagine
Mr. Fabian's feelings when after having congratulated
himself that his wife's anger with her nephew would occupy
her mind for the entire evening, he received a summons
from her that the boat and fishing tackle were ready
for use.</p>

<p>Fishing was one of Mistress Ulrica's favorite pastimes,
and although she did not generally participate in it, yet
when she observed her husband's unskillfulness, she would
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>indignantly cast aside her parasol, and grasp the fishing
rod. However it may be, whether the water queen below
wished to compliment the earthly queen above,&mdash;we
know that ladies are prone to be polite to each other&mdash;or
that some truant fish remained behind to become an
easy prey to the enemy, suffice it to say that Mistress
Ulrica was generally fortunate; but she did not&mdash;as she
might have done&mdash;make use of her advantage, as she
herself would say, "to cause her husband to blush with
shame."</p>

<p>When the dutiful husband arrived at the landing, he
found his tender wife, standing near the boat, clasping her
child's hand in her own, and our friend was obliged to see
that his jewels were safely seated in the boat. After he
had rowed the skiff out as far as Ulrica thought was proper,
he with many misgivings threw out his line.</p>

<p>"How strange it is my dear Fabian, that every time you
fish you sit still there on your seat like a perfect automaton!"</p>

<p>With this preamble, Mistress Ulrica opened the floodgates
of her ill-humor, to which on occasions like the present
especially she gave perfect freedom.</p>

<p>"An automaton, my dear!"</p>

<p>"A post, a perfect post. You do not even turn your
head; just as though the company of your wife and child
was the most wearisome thing of your life."</p>

<p><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>But dearest Ulrique Eugenie, I must keep watch for a
bite. If I turn around&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would not lose the sense of feeling if you should;
but you hope, I suppose, that persons on the shore will
think you master of the boat. Simpleton! What folly
to think that!"</p>

<p>"Dear Ulrique Eugenie, shall I ask if you have spared
my nephew your ill-humor that you may vent it on me.
It is my opinion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is your opinion, sir?"</p>

<p>"O nothing further than that I am sufficiently burdened
with your natural bad-temper already, without having it
increased by the aid of another."</p>

<p>"Burdened!&mdash;ill-humor&mdash;bad temper!&mdash;is the man
mad? Do you thus speak to me, your wedded wife, who
bears your stupid indifference; your want of tenderness
and love with angelic forbearance? O, this is too much!
It is shameful! It is undeserved!"</p>

<p>"Now, now, Ulgenie, do not be so hasty. You know
how patient I am."</p>

<p>"And what am I, then, to be married to such a musty
husband? Your wife is courted before your very eyes;
you see nothing! you hear nothing!&mdash;I could be unfaithful
to you, and even then you would close your eyes. O, fate!
O bitter life! such a husband can drive a wife to desperation,
and from thence it is but one step to madness."</p>

<p>"Who is again playing the gallant to you?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>And in this "again," reposed an expression which displayed
that such scenes were not new to him. Mistress
Ulrica, like other women, possessed her weak points, one
of which was that if a gentleman happened to converse
with her pleasantly, she immediately imagined that he was
desperately in love with her. But to her great sorrow,
Mrs. Ulrica, although she possessed entire control over her
husband's actions, never could make an Othello of him.
Had Mr. Fabian but known her desire in this respect, he
could have deprived his wife of her sceptre, and taken up
the reins of matrimonial government himself.</p>

<p>A tyrannical husband would have been able to bend
Mrs. Ulrica like a reed, and to have trodden her under
his feet which she would willingly have kissed; but now
Mr. Fabian kissed her feet, and therefore she crushed him
to the dust, and although she did not merit the reproach
that Desdemona received, it was, nevertheless, no fault of
his. But of what use would it have been even should
she have merited it? Othello was a fanciful creation
which her husband of all men would have been least willing
to personate.</p>

<p>"My Fabian," she would say to herself, "my Fabian
can never prove unfaithful to me. He is too much of an
idler, and thinks only of his sofa, pipe and tobacco."</p>

<p>But we will resume the thread of the worthy couple's
conversation.</p>

<p><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>"Who is again making love to you?" inquired Mr.
Fabian again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ulrica uplifted her reproachful eyes to Heaven.
"He asks who! he has not even observed it!"</p>

<p>"No, my dear wife, I have not."</p>

<p>"And yet he has this entire day&mdash;," she turned her
face aside, feigning to conceal a blush.</p>

<p>"To-day! Why we have had no gentlemen guests to-day,
except the pastor's assistant who came with the
young ladies, and took his departure before they did."</p>

<p>"No gentlemen guests! As if he, the accomplished
scholar, and entertaining gentleman, was nobody! and it
was nothing that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what further?"</p>

<p>"That he, carried away by those charms, that you
have so long observed with indifference, should become
deeply smitten with me."</p>

<p>"What! Do you think he entertains a secret affection
for you?"</p>

<p>"Affection, I will not say affection; but passion, which
word your dull brain cannot comprehend, you virtuous
and modest Joseph!" the lady laughed at her own joke,
and then continued, "I am not certain whether I had better
tell the young man that I have discovered his hope;
but I shall be forced to forbid his visiting me, which will
be the same as telling the whole world how this delicate
affair stands."</p>

<p><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>"Will you permit me to give you a little advice?" said
Mr. Fabian.</p>

<p>"Why not, Fabian, you are my husband, and as such
you have the right to do so."</p>

<p>"Then I would say, drop the subject where it stands."</p>

<p>"Are you not fearful! Do you not shudder at the possibility
of an unpleasant event?"</p>

<p>"O, my dearest Ulgenie, can I for a moment doubt your
strength of soul, your virtue?"</p>

<p>"It is true I am thus strongly armed, and I thank you,
my dear Fabian, for confiding in my faithfulness."&mdash;As
was usual a few cheering sun-beams followed the cooling
shower.&mdash;"Forgive me, my dear husband, for harrowing
your feelings; but there are times when even the strongest
minded are weak."</p>

<p>"You are an exception, my love."</p>

<p>These confident words had nearly renewed the vexation
within Mistress Ulrica's bosom; but suddenly she was
struck with an idea that caused her to assume a still more
affectionate expression of countenance.</p>

<p>"We will trouble ourselves no more concerning that
deeply to be pitied young man. I have something else
which I wish to confide to you."</p>

<p>"Another lover?" inquired Mr. Fabian, widening his
eyes.</p>

<p>"I refer to a youth, for whose welfare I am deeply concerned."</p>

<p><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>"Explain yourself, my dear."</p>

<p>"Fabian, you must not hate him, for the young man
does not understand himself, this I will answer for with my
life, and perhaps he only indulges a platonic affection for
one who realizes the romantic ideas which his youthful
imagination had formerly brought forth."</p>

<p>"You do not mean Gottlieb, do you?" inquired Fabian,
unsuccessfully endeavoring to conceal a laugh.</p>

<p>"Fabian, why do you speak so sardonically? If in spite
of your watchfulness, his has, unobserved by you, paid a
tribute to your wife's beauty, you must remember that he
did not know he was sinning. It was merely an accident
that made me acquainted with the secret of his heart."</p>

<p>"Will you permit me to inquire what that accident
was?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure. I had&mdash;I tell you this in confidence&mdash;I
had chosen one of the pastor's daughters as his wife; I
invited her to Almvik to-day, but he avoided her presence.
He retired to that solitude which he seeks every evening
either before or after we go out on our drive. A certain
instinctive sentiment causes him to leave the house when
you are absent, and more than all, when I reproached him
for his faults, and pointed to the advantageous match I
had in view for him, he had the boldness to say that he
would retain to himself the right of disposing of his own
heart."</p>

<p><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>"And do you believe, my dear, that you are the first
cause of this trouble?"</p>

<p>"I have felt grieved at the thought that it might be so,
nothing further."</p>

<p>"Well, well, dear Ulgenie, I will release you from this
burden on your conscience."</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian, who always found it a difficult matter to
converse long upon a serious matter, spoke the above
words in a tone of voice especially lively, for his heart was
rejoiced at the thought that now he had an opportunity of
ridding himself of an unwelcome guest, without giving
cause for any one to believe that it was his own desire to
do so.</p>

<p>"What are you babbling about?" inquired Mistress
Ulrica, sharply, "what do you know about my nephew's
affairs?"</p>

<p>"Nothing further than that he has had a little love affair
of his own, which occupies his attention during those solitary
walks you referred to a moment ago."</p>

<p>"He! Gottlieb! Has he dared to fall in love!"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"But I assure you that it is true, and if you will ask
him why he so frequently visits the valley, he certainly will
not deny that he goes there for the purpose of meeting
handsome Nanna, the daughter of old Mr. Lonner. He
reads poetry to her, and under the pretence of teaching
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>her the guitar, he finds an opportunity of pressing her
pretty little white hands."</p>

<p>"If that is true. If he, while he remains under my
roof, enters into such a miserable intrigue, I will&mdash;for I
consider it my duty as occupying the place of his mother&mdash;I
will to-morrow morning mar his plans. But how did
you learn this?"</p>

<p>This was a question which Mr. Fabian could not truthfully
answer, for if he should do so, he would have been
obliged to state that he, after his disagreeable parting with
Magde, had taken a roundabout path towards Almvik,
which conducted him so near the valley that he discovered
two persons sitting beneath the tree near the fountain, and
that from that day forward he had closely watched Gottlieb's
movements, so that he might be enabled to hold a
weapon over the one who might perhaps be a spy upon
his own actions.</p>

<p>It was therefore an accident which opened Mr. Fabian's
eyes to Gottlieb's crime; but he had not wished to play the
part of an accuser, O, no, for such love affairs were common
to all young men, at least he thus assured his wife.</p>

<p>"Make no excuse for him, sir," interrupted Mistress
Ulrica sharply, "this indeed is excellent, and will become
still richer if not prevented in time. The reproaches of a
mother on the one hand, and the curses of a father on the
other; a seduced girl, perhaps something worse; a criminal
investigation, and a scandal in which our house, and
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>possibly ourselves, will figure largely; all this we must
expect. As true as my name is Ulrique Eugenie, this matter
shall have an end, and a speedy end, too."</p>

<p>"But how will you accomplish that?" inquired Fabian.</p>

<p>"That I shall attend to myself. Gottlieb has said
that he should like to travel over the mountains into
Norway. Now then he can go to Amal, and from thence
he may commence his journey. He shall have money, but
must obey me."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The following morning, after Mistress Ulrica had convinced
herself by her own eyes of the truth of her husband's
report, for she followed Gottlieb to the meadow
that morning instead of taking her usual ride, Gottlieb was
summoned to her apartment, and underwent an examination
that nearly exhausted his entire stock of patience. The
interview resulted in his determination to accept his aunt's
proposal, that he should take a journey into Norway. He
did not inform Nanna, however, of the cause of his sudden
departure, for he feared that it would grieve her.</p>

<p>Their last interview was cheered by bright anticipations
of the day when Gottlieb should return and observe the
improvement which Nanna should make, both in her performance
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>on the guitar, and in her education; for when
his aunt had made a contract of peace with him, Gottlieb
had insisted that Nanna should have the guitar, to which
clause the old lady consented.</p>

<p>The young couple parted in the hope of a joyful meeting,
and Gottlieb's farewell kiss did not assist Nanna to
forget him.</p>

<p>The next day after Gottlieb had taken his departure, Jon
Jonson's sloop arrived in the bay opposite the little cottage
in the valley.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Grief.</span></h3>


<p>Nearly two months had elapsed since those remarkable
days on which Nanna had received her first kiss, and
Magde had heard from her husband by the arrival of Jon
Jonson's sloop.</p>

<p>Great had been her joy when Ragnar's gifts arrived
in safety.&mdash;She then thought that everything had come to
a good conclusion. But greatly was she deceived! There
was a man to whom Magde had invariably conducted
herself with cool indifference, and who, after having been
defeated by her in the manner which we have before described
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>bestowed upon her a parting glance which had
caused her to shudder as if she had trodden upon a serpent.
And he was indeed a serpent in human guise, for
soon she felt the delayed sting of the venomous reptile.</p>

<p>Until Ragnar had received his appointment as mate, old
Mr. Lonner had invariably purchased his supplies of the
merchants at Goteborg; but as Ragnar thought that
foreign goods could be obtained much cheaper by procuring
them himself, and sending them home without paying
the duty, he soon persuaded the old man to adopt his
opinion on the subject.</p>

<p>Until now no unpleasant consequence had resulted
from Ragnar's occasionally smuggling a few articles for
the use of the family; but the old adage says "a pitcher
which goes oft to the fountain is soon broken," and in Ragnar's
case this proverb was verified.</p>

<p>Yet, for this accident, the custom house officers were
not so much to blame, for not one in that service would
have thought for a moment of searching the cottage in
the valley, unless positive information was received, nay
more, unless that information was accompanied with
threats of exposure, for dereliction of duty. Unfortunately,
the custom house stamp was wanting upon the handkerchiefs,
shawls, and other goods sent by Ragnar, and
the family not only were deprived of them, but were menaced
with fines and penalties, which to pay, was entirely
out of their power. To add to their misfortune their
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>protector, Ragnar, who would have soon put an end to
their troubles, had started a few days before the catastrophe,
upon a voyage to Brazil.</p>

<p>Magde and Nanna wept only when they were alone, or
at least when they were with each other. They concealed
their tears from the old man, his life should not be further
embittered; it was bitter enough already. The little fortune
on which they had hoped to subsist for many months
was entirely swept away. Old Mr. Lonner, however, observed
the secret grief of his daughters, and said to himself:</p>

<p>"Poor children, you do not know what is yet to
come."</p>

<p>The smuggled goods were marked with old Mr. Lonner's
name only, and he well knew that a heavy penalty
was yet to follow.</p>

<p>"We have enjoyed so much happiness, and peace, since
Ragnar and Magde were married," said he encouragingly
to his daughter, "that we should bravely endure a little
misfortune. It is not allotted to man that he should enjoy
a constant season of prosperity."</p>

<p>But Nanna and Magde smiled sorrowfully as he thus
spoke. The inmates of the cottage now exerted themselves
to the utmost to better their sad condition. Our
friend Carl exerted himself beyond all the others. He
who had neglected the affairs of his own relations for
those of his neighbors, now scarcely had leisure to step
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>beyond the boundary line of his father's estate. He was
everything, and did everything so willingly and skilfully,
that it was not necessary for the family to hire any servant
to assist them as they had formerly done, and although
latterly he had been somewhat feeble in health, he cared
not for himself, but worked manfully in wet as well as dry
weather. His troubles and toil were all forgotten, when
Magde would reward him for his efforts with a friendly
nod of her head.</p>

<p>And when she would say, "You will work yourself to
death, my Carl," he would laugh pleasantly, and immediately
renew his efforts ten fold. He now determined that
after his duties at home were performed, to go among the
neighbors; not to be a nurse for their children, as before,
but to work for wages, and after this when he returned
and placed the money on Magde's weaving loom, a bright
object might have been discovered glistening upon the
crumpled bank-note. It was a tear of joy which Carl had
shed.</p>

<p>Magde after the first occurrence of this incident, dared
to praise Carl no further. She already perceived the consequence
of so doing, but after the lilacs and lilies had faded,
the tulips, roses and lavender bushes, bloomed, and
however weary Magde might find herself after a day of
toil, she would each evening place elegant boquets in
Carl's flower vases.</p>

<p>At length, and too soon, the decision in regard to the
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>smuggled goods arrived, and as Mr. Lonner was unable
to pay the penalty imposed upon him, he was doomed to
imprisonment. In this their day of trouble, Mr. Lonner
alone retained his courage.</p>

<p>He well knew in truth to whom they were indebted for
their distress, but he feared nothing. He trusted in the
belief that Magde would do all that was in her power to
raise the sum of money necessary to pay the fine. It was
unfortunate, however, that Magde, without the old man's
knowledge, had expended their small stock of money to
pay a few debts that they had contracted the previous
spring.</p>

<p>We will not attempt to depict the misery of the moment
when old Mr. Lonner stepped into the boat which was to
conduct him to the prison at Harad which was located on
the opposite side of the lake, and where he was to be confined
for the time being. Both of his daughters wished
to accompany him to the opposite shore; but he forbade
them so seriously that they dared not press their desires
further.</p>

<p>It was touching to observe these sorrow stricken
females, amidst their terror search high and low in the
cottage for various articles of comfort for their beloved
father. At length, with a slight degree of sorrowful impatience
old Mr. Lonner ordered the boatmen to push
off from the shore, and then it was piteous in the extreme
to behold both Magde and Nanna, as they clung to the
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>gunwale, to whisper their tearful adieu's, and to promise
that they would pay him a visit in his prison in a few
days.</p>

<p>Finally the bitter moment was over; the boat rapidly
proceeded from the land; but so long as they could discern
the old man's white locks fluttering in the breeze and
even until the boat appeared a speck in the distance, Nanna
and Magde remained on the shore gazing out upon the
water.</p>

<p>In the meantime Carl without the knowledge of the
family had proceeded to the opposite shore of the lake,
and when the boat which contained his father touched the
shore, Carl greeted him tenderly and presented him with
a ten dollar bank note. This was a treasure indeed, and
Carl had obtained it by selling the only article of value which
he possessed. It was a silver watch, which his mother
had given him before she died.</p>

<p>On his return home that evening he remarked:&mdash;"Father
need not fear. He can live in his prison rolling in
riches; a gentleman met him on the other shore and
loaned him ten dollars."</p>

<p>How Magde and Nanna blessed the kind hearted gentleman;
but their joy was but momentary. What should
they do now? How should they provide for themselves
in this unexpected trouble. Their poor neighbors like
themselves, were moneyless, and their wealthy neighbors
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>would undoubtedly require some security before they
would loan them money.</p>

<p>Nanna often looked towards the spot in the meadow,
so full of pleasant memories. If her kind friend would only
return. He certainly, would be able to advise them
how to act in their present strait.</p>

<p>Three days elapsed after the old man's departure, and
many were the plans formed by Magde, but the only apparently
feasible one, was that which she would most unwillingly
undertake to carry into effect. She was perfectly
convinced that the proprietor of Almvik would willingly
assist her; but he would do it <i>too</i> willingly, for afterwards
he would cause her to feel that she was in his debt.</p>

<p>"But," thought she in a maze of doubt and fear, "what
shall I do? Is it better to remain as we are and allow the
poor old man to languish in prison, or to go to Almvik,
and thus receive the only boon our father wishes, liberty?
But what would Ragnar advise me to do. He loves his
father as he does the apple of his eye; but his wife he
loves as he does his own heart&mdash;And then if he should
imagine that Mr. Fabian H&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;Oh! my God! what
trouble would then arise!&mdash;but again I shall not be
able to assist the old man&mdash;no, no, that will not do, I
can hold out no longer."</p>

<p>Magde had no person with whom to consult, for what
advice could poor Carl give? Nanna was a mere child,
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>and Magde felt that she could not consult her upon such
an intricate question.</p>

<p>She had conversed with the parson concerning her trouble,
yet although he was not backward in giving her good
advice, he nevertheless refused to assist her with his purse,
for he was as miserly as he was wealthy.</p>

<p>The time had now arrived when Magde could no longer
postpone the promised visit to her father, and all the
members of the family wished to go upon this little pilgrimage.
Great were the preparations that were made
to supply themselves with a sufficient quantity of provisions
which they were to take to the old man. Magde
baked pan-cakes, and Nanna made pies, and if a smile did
appear on Magde's lips it was when they spoke of the
pleasant surprise they were preparing for their father.</p>

<p>At length the moment for their departure arrived.
Even little Christine and the favorite dog Carlo, were to
form a portion of the company, that they might be able to
see their old friend. The children leaped with joy.</p>

<p>They thought only of the pleasant trip over the swelling
billows of the lake. Magde finished lading the skiff; but
her heart was overflowing with grief, for she had no glad
tidings with which to gladden the heart of the old man.</p>

<p>Nanna who during the busy activity of the morning had
successfully endeavored to suppress her sorrow, was so
much overcome as she was about stepping into the boat that
she nearly fainted. She saw in her imagination the pale and
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>suffering countenance of her father; who was however
smiling patiently as he stood ready to greet his children,
that were to leave him again in his dreary and lonely prison.</p>

<p>The poor child in anticipation suffered all the pangs of
a second farewell with her imprisoned parent.</p>

<p>"It will not do for you to accompany us," said Magde
in a firm and motherly tone, "you are ill, and therefore
had better return."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," replied Nanna trembling violently, "that
I shall be obliged to do so. Give my love to him, and tell
him&mdash;" and now her long suppressed tears burst forth
in torrents&mdash;"tell him if I do not come, it is not because
I do not love him."</p>

<p>"Silence, silence my poor sister, I know myself what I
have to say&mdash;Go and may God be with you&mdash;here is
the key&mdash;Lock the door&mdash;Carl take the oars."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Banishment&mdash;The Re-Union.</span></h3>


<p>When Magde's boat passed the mansion at Almvik,
two persons were walking on the verge of the shore near
the lake. The one was Mistress Ulrica, and her companion
was Gottlieb, who had returned a few days before,
from his trip through Norway.</p>

<p>As the boat shot round a rocky point of land, Gottlieb
exclaimed, as he recognized its occupants, and bowed
friendly to them: "Where are they all going! They look
so sorrowful and dejected!"</p>

<p>"Sorrowful!" repeated Mrs. Ulrica, "you may thank<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>
God that it is not necessary for you to participate in the
sorrows of the lower classes."</p>

<p>"If they are in trouble, I do not see why I should not
sympathise with them."</p>

<p>Aunt Ulrica shook her head with a dissatisfied expression
of countenance.</p>

<p>"You may certainly boast of your firmness of mind, and
your knowledge of human nature; I have shown you the
danger of associating with such persons. I sent you
away&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," interrupted Gottlieb, hastily, "I
was not <i>sent</i> away. I took a journey which I had decided
on myself, and returned as I departed, with a heart ever
ready to sympathise with the afflicted."</p>

<p>"Then go, and participate in the sorrows of your beggar
friends. I suppose, from your liberal words, that you
are well supplied with money."</p>

<p>"What has happened to them?"</p>

<p>"The old man, in connection with his son, has been detected
in smuggling foreign goods, and of course his
property was confiscated. The old gentleman in whose
name the business was transacted, was sent to prison because
he had no money to pay the penalty, and there he
will remain until you go to his release."</p>

<p>"And he shall not wait long," replied Gottlieb. "I
have accomplished greater undertakings than that in my
time."</p>

<p><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>"Ah, ha," sneered Mrs. Ulrica, "you speak boldly, boy.
I am astonished."</p>

<p>"If any one should be astonished, I am the person."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"I come to relatives who at first welcomed me cordially.
My affections attached themselves to my kind friends, for
it is a necessary quality for me to be grateful; but suddenly
everything is changed, and I am treated like a school
boy, whom you must curb, or else fear that he might commit
some folly. To this description of guardianship I
have not been accustomed, and as it is not my desire to
submit to your control, I must beg you, Aunt Ulrica, not
to attempt to govern me in this manner, for I assure you
that your efforts will always be fruitless."</p>

<p>"Foolish boy! You forget that I could be useful to
you; could smooth your path by my wealth and influence."</p>

<p>"I do not forget it, and I should have been very happy
to have been able to retain your good will; but at the
price of my liberty of thought and action, I do not desire
your favor."</p>

<p>"Then you will return to the valley, to Miss Nanna."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. She requires my presence, and I long
to see her."</p>

<p>"Then you still love the young girl?" inquired Mrs.
Ulrica.</p>

<p>"I do not know whether I loved her when I departed
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>from Almvik; but this much I do know, that her image
has been with me constantly during my absence; and that
I shall see her again to-day."</p>

<p>"To tell her of this folly?"</p>

<p>"O, no, that would be unjust, as I can tell her nothing
more."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven for that! You, yourself, see that it
would be impossible to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" inquired Gottlieb, as his aunt paused.</p>

<p>"To marry her."</p>

<p>"I do not at all consider it impossible; but as it is uncertain
whether I ought to wed Nanna when the time
arrives for me to marry, it is better for both of us that we
should rest satisfied with friendship alone."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Gottlieb. Sometimes you speak so
wisely that I am not certain but that it would repay me
to make a proposal to you."</p>

<p>"Well, I am all attention."</p>

<p>"If I am not much mistaken, pity is the only sentiment
that you feel for that girl, Nanna. If I was to take it
upon myself to pay the old man's fine; if I should further
promise you to provide for Nanna's future maintenance&mdash;you
know I would not break my word&mdash;will you bind
yourself not to see her again?"</p>

<p>"No, I will never do that. She would be oppressed
with sorrow throughout her whole life, if I should be
capable of making such an unworthy promise."</p>

<p><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>"Obstinate youth! you force me to perform my duty
to your mother my sister, and command you to visit Almvik
no longer. I will not burden my conscience by abetting
you in your misconduct."</p>

<p>"I will remain a few days longer," replied Gottlieb
without evincing the slightest emotion, "to rest myself
after my journey, and then I shall be ready to obey your
command."</p>

<p>"Right," muttered Mrs. Ulrica hotly, as she hastily
left the young man, "you shall repent this."</p>

<p>Without wasting time by thinking upon this conversation
with his aunt, Gottlieb hastened on the road towards
the little cottage. He had observed Nanna was not in the
boat, and after proceeding to the spring, and fruitlessly
searching for her, he hurried to the cottage, his
heart beating with such rapidity as he stood before the
door, that he was astonished at his great emotion.</p>

<p>"Illness could not have prevented her from going with
them," thought he, "certainly not, or they would have
remained with her."</p>

<p>Thus thinking he knocked at the door; but he was
obliged to repeat the summons several times before he
heard the sound of slow footsteps approaching.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" inquired a soft voice from within.</p>

<p>"'Tis I, Nanna!"</p>

<p>An exclamation of joyful surprise was the only reply.
The bolt was quickly thrown back; the door opened, and<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>
Nanna appeared upon the threshold, pale and careworn.
She was clothed in her only holiday dress, a black merino
frock which fitted closely around her neck, thereby disclosing
her graceful bust to its best advantage.</p>

<p>Without speaking, but overwhelmed with her joyful
emotions, she cast herself in Gottlieb's arms, and never
was there a purer embrace given or returned than on this
occasion. With tender gentleness Gottlieb imprinted his
second kiss upon her lips, and then said softly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poor Nanna, poor child, you have at least one friend
in your adversity."</p>

<p>"Then Gottlieb is acquainted with&mdash;" She blushingly
withdrew herself from his embrace. She had not thought
that her greeting had been contrary to customary usage.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know your sorrow; and you may rest assured
that I will give myself no rest, during the few days that I
remain here, until I see your father at liberty and safely
in his own house again."</p>

<p>"O, if that were but possible!" she clasped her hands
and lifted her eyes, confidingly, to the face of her youthful
friend.</p>

<p>"It shall be possible, Nanna. You have my word for
it. If I had been here it would not have happened."</p>

<p>"I thought so. An inner voice told me that if <i>he</i>
would only come to us all would be well again."</p>

<p>"I am grateful for your confidence and shall always
remember it with pleasure."</p>

<p><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>"Remember it!" exclaimed Nanna, "are you going to
leave us again?"</p>

<p>Nanna again clasped her hands, and this action and the
mournful expression of her countenance spoke more than
words could have expressed.</p>

<p>"Will you miss me, Nanna?"</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p>"And perhaps wish we had never met?" inquired Gottlieb
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Ah, no," replied Nanna warmly, "the remembrance
of you will perhaps work a happier future for me than I
would have had without it."</p>

<p>"But tell me," said Gottlieb changing the subject to
one less dangerous, "why did not your sister apply to the
proprietor of Almvik."</p>

<p>"O, she would never apply to him. She would rather
allow things to take their own course."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"I know not whether I dare tell you. Papa and
Magde, consider me a mere child, yet I can understand
that Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; has sought her with wrong motives, and
if I can believe my brother, Carl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What then?" interrupted Gottlieb eagerly.</p>

<p>"Then I can believe that all of our troubles have originated
in the fact that Magde refused to give that gentleman
a kiss when he requested it."</p>

<p>"What, did he wish to purchase a kiss?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>"Yes, for Carl's pardon," and now Nanna related every
circumstance connected with the theft of the game, in nearly
the same words in which she had heard it from Carl.</p>

<p>After a short season of reflection, during which he compared
the different circumstances, Gottlieb arrived at the
same conclusion that Carl had expressed to his sister; and
at the same time he also fancied that he had discovered a
method for old Mr. Lonner's release, which could not fail
of success. In the meantime he merely inquired whether
Mr. Fabian H&mdash;&mdash; had visited the cottage since his discomfiture.</p>

<p>"I have several times observed him prowling about the
premises," replied Nanna; "he probably hoped to have an
opportunity of seeing Magde alone, which however he has
never had, for even should he offer his assistance, she
would not have dared to accept it, for if she did, Ragnar
would be very angry."</p>

<p>When Gottlieb returned to Almvik, he learned that his
worthy uncle, whom as he before knew had left the house
early that morning, was not expected to return until late
in the evening. In consequence of this unfortunate circumstance,
Gottlieb saw nothing before him except a vexatious
delay in his intended operations; but it soon entered
his mind that Mr. Fabian's absence might be connected
in some degree with his wayward love. The day on which
he had visited Magde, in order to take advantage of Carl's
theft, he had also departed from Almvik in the morning,<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>
for during the evening hours his wife was invariably on the
watch.</p>

<p>The more Gottlieb considered this circumstance the more
he was convinced that if his uncle had sown the seed it
was done for his own benefit, and undoubtedly the time
was now at hand when he should reap the harvest.</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought Gottlieb, "if I should only be so fortunate
as to obtain a power over my uncle, my suspicions
and conjectures would exert a powerful influence upon his
yielding disposition, especially, if I should place his wife in
the back-ground. But to surprise him, with my own eyes
in forbidden grounds, would be as good as to have old
Mr. Lonner safe back in his cottage again."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Prisoner.</span></h3>


<p>While the incidents last narrated were transpiring on
the one side of the lake, Magde's boat had reached the
other, and the occupants of the boat were about landing,
yes, Carl had even secured the boat to the stake, when
one of the little ones in attempting to reach the landing,
fell overboard with a loud cry.</p>

<p>The young and always self-possessed mother, answered
the boy's cry, not by crying out herself, but by springing
into the water after him, and when Carl turned to learn
the cause of the confusion, she had already reached her
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>little boy, and was holding him up at arm's length out of
the water. It was all done in a moment, without the least
unnecessary confusion.</p>

<p>"Carl," said she quietly, "take the boy."</p>

<p>But Carl had lost his self-possession entirely. After
he had literally thrown the boy on the landing, he inquired
with a trembling voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Could you not wait for me? The boy would not have
sunk immediately."</p>

<p>"You must not scold me, Carl, I am only a little wet."</p>

<p>She then quietly drew herself to the shore.</p>

<p>"How will you dry yourself now?" inquired Carl in a
tone of uneasiness and vexation.</p>

<p>"O, easily, I will call on Mother Larsson and borrow a
dress to wear while we visit our father, and my clothing
will be dry by the time we return."</p>

<p>Carl was silent. He was displeased because Magde
had not called him to her assistance. Meanwhile he proceeded
with the children to the prison, that he might prepare
the old man for the visit. Magde did not tarry long
at Mother Larsson's. As soon as she had obtained the
necessary garments, she hurried on, clothed in a neat peasant's
frock which fitted her fine form gracefully.</p>

<p>The prison at Harad was located in the ruins of an old
castle. Its outward appearance presented a dark and forbidding
aspect. The heart of the beholder would contract
within him as he gazed upon those ruins of fallen greatness,
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>as they reposed before him, dark and deserted, like
an evil omen in his path.</p>

<p>But the interior of the prison, with its tottering weather
beaten projections, apparently ready to fall from their resting
places, presented an appearance still more gloomy
and forbidding. Dampness, and mould of a hundred
years growth had obliterated all traces of the fresco paintings
that had formerly ornamented the ceiling, on which
the moisture had gathered and fell at regular intervals
with a hollow patter upon the stone pavement below.</p>

<p>The places once occupied by glittering chandeliers were
now shrouded with immense spider webs, in which a whole
colony of spiders lived subsisting on the noisome vapors
of this gloomy charnel like abode.</p>

<p>Aside from these poisonous insects, an occasional rat,
and a few unfortunate prisoners, there were no other inhabitants
in this dark prison. A flock of jackdaws had
built their nest beneath the eaves of the old castle, and as
they received good treatment from the prisoners they
would pay them a passing visit at their grated windows
to look in upon them or to receive a few crumbs of bread.
Old Mr. Lonner had already made their acquaintance and
derived much pleasure from attending to their little wants,
while he anxiously awaited the arrival of his children.</p>

<p>When Magde arrived she found Carl had prepared the
way for her so that she, without hindrance, proceeded
directly to the old man's cell. Mr. Lonner was deeply
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>moved by the visit of his children; but he appeared perfectly
resigned. Magde's two children were seated upon
his knees, while Carl was standing before him relating
all that had transpired during his imprisonment. The
cloud which had rested upon the old man's brow changed
instantly to an expression of joy when he beheld Magde
the wife of his beloved son, enter the room. His arms
trembled as he embraced her, and his heart throbbed painfully
when she described her sorrows and troubles, and
told him that Nanna had nearly fainted as they were about
entering the boat, at the mere thought of the second
parting.</p>

<p>"It was right to leave her behind," said Mr. Lonner,
"and if we can only find some means whereby I may be
released before the autumn, that the cold may not increase
my feebleness, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Means must be found, father, I think, of immediately
going to the city, to take our cow and the two sheep with
me, aside from those I will also take the piece of linen
which I have made for Ragnar's shirts. By adding all
these together I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, dear daughter, if you sell the cow, how will these
little ones prosper?" He clasped his hands upon the two
little white heads of the children who were sitting in his
lap.</p>

<p>"O, I can borrow some milk of our neighbors, and we
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>can repay them in the fall, after Ragnar returns, for then
we shall have another cow."</p>

<p>"That will never do, my child. We must discover
some other method."</p>

<p>"I had an idea, also," said Carl, advancing from a corner
into which he had withdrawn when Magde entered.</p>

<p>"What is it, my good boy?" inquired his father.</p>

<p>"I was thinking about that which Ragnar has so often
told us, about the people in England who procured money
by pawning themselves&mdash;what was it he called it?" continued
he, scratching his head to arouse his memory.</p>

<p>"Life Insurance, was it not?" replied his father.</p>

<p>"That's it, father, and Ragnar also told me that even
here in Sweden, gold might be obtained from England on
such terms. Now, if we could find some one who understood
this matter, and would undertake to draw up the
proper writings, I would willingly give my life as security,
and then you see, father, I should be just the same as so
much ready money."</p>

<p>"My good son, your words are well intended; but it is
not as you think in relation to Life Insurance."</p>

<p>"O, that is too bad, father, or you might have received
a large sum of money when I am dead."</p>

<p>"My life, I hope, will be finished before yours," said his
father, "I am old, and you are young."</p>

<p>"True, I am young in years; but lately, yes, last Friday,
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>while I passed through the church yard, I heard a
voice, and that voice I believed."</p>

<p>"What ideas you invent!" exclaimed Magde, frightened
for the first time, as she observed Carl's hollow cheeks and
sunken eye, "but what did the voice say?"</p>

<p>"'Carl, Carl, Carl,' it said, calling my name three times,
'you will not live long.'"</p>

<p>"Your brain is weak, my boy, because you have worked
too hard. When your body has received rest, and rest it
must have, you will feel much better. But tell me, Carl,
what you thought when you imagined you heard the
voice."</p>

<p>"I did not think, but merely replied, 'indeed.'"</p>

<p>"But, Carl, with this superstition you will make your
father sorrowful."</p>

<p>"Sorrowful? I do not think so. Should he be sorrowful
because our Saviour in his grace is willing to call
me to his fold? Instead of being sorrowful, the day
of my departure should be a festive day. How many
troubles do we escape after we are placed in the earth!"</p>

<p>"But if you think in that manner, you will become
mournful yourself, you will not be able to laugh any
more."</p>

<p>"Not laugh," replied Carl, and without an effort he
commenced laughing merrily. His face glowed with
mirthfulness, and his melancholy humor seemed to have
vanished as if by magic. It appeared so strange to him
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>that Magde should desire him to laugh, that he forgot all
about the life insurance or the warning voice, and once thus
engaged, he took no farther part in the consultation.</p>

<p>An hour elapsed, and Magde, after having emptied the
basket of its contents, experienced a return from the hope
that had sustained her during the interview, to her former
despondency, as the moment of parting approached. Carl
proceeded in advance to prepare the boat.</p>

<p>"In four days, at the furtherest, I shall return," said
Magde, pausing upon the threshold of her father's cell,
"and then, as I hope for Ragnar's continued love, I shall
bring you good tidings."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear Magde. Ragnar shall learn all
that you have done for his old father. Kiss Nanna, poor
little innocent, for me, and tell her that she must not come
here, for it will only make her heart more heavy and
sad."</p>

<p>A moment later, and the creaking doors resounded
throughout the ruins, the prisoner was again alone.</p>

<p>But once more did he hear a dear voice, for when
Magde arrived at the outside, she remembered with a feeling
of uneasiness, that her youngest child had not been
blessed by its grandfather. In the haste of departure, the
little one had been entirely forgotten; but as it was impossible
for her to leave the prison with the dear child unblessed,
she stood beneath the grated window, and exclaimed:</p>

<p><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>"Father, dear father, please look through the window,
and I will hold up the baby for you, that you may give it
your blessing."</p>

<p>Immediately the old man's white head appeared at the
window, and Magde held the child aloft in her hands
towards him.</p>

<p>And now everything was performed rightly; the last
farewell glances were exchanged, and then Magde and her
children disappeared from the old man's sight.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gottlieb on the Watch.</span></h3>


<p>The heat of the day had been followed by the pleasant
coolness of an August evening. The hands of the clock
pointed to the hour of ten, and Gottlieb, who had been
walking during the entire evening in the neighborhood
of the little red cottage, began to think that his uncle Fabian
had in all comfort reached his home by another
road.</p>

<p>"It is so quiet in the cottage," thought he, "that I think
they have all retired."</p>

<p>He glanced stealthily over the lilac hedge towards<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>
Magde's window. The entire valley was bathed in moonlight,
and the moonbeams glanced directly through the
window panes of Magde's apartment, with such vivid
brightness that Gottlieb was undecided how to act.</p>

<p>Soon, however, he resolved to convince himself of the
true state of affairs, that he might be prepared if his uncle
should arrive.</p>

<p>He gradually made an opening in the hedge and having
found his way clear before him he advanced to the window
which, as the weather was warm, was secured only by a
small cord. He glanced through the window, and a beautiful
picture met his gaze. In this chamber, the husband
and wife's little temple, the moonlight was brilliantly
reflected from Ragnar's brightly polished hunting and
fishing implements which, neatly arranged, were hung
against the walls.</p>

<p>At the opposite side of the room, a much worn sailor's
hat, commonly called a tarpaulin, was balanced upon the
point of a fishing rod, and beneath this trophy was placed
a small side board, the open doors of which disclosed a
number of shelves laden with gilt edged drinking vessels
of white and blue china; a set of rose colored tea-cups,
and several polished silver plated mugs. A few uncommonly
excellent specimens of carving in wood, decorated
one of the shelves, and another shelf contained several articles
of jewelry which Magde had received both before
and after she was married. All these little valuables<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>
Magde had gathered together, after she had put the children
to bed, in the hope that she might find some few articles
among them that would save her from disposing of
the cow.</p>

<p>But her search, undoubtedly, had proved fruitless, for
Magde's ornaments were made almost entirely of bronze.</p>

<p>Seated in a chair with her hand resting upon the cradle,
Magde was now sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>She had been called, probably, while she was engaged
in assorting her little treasures, to attend to the wants of
her infant, and overcome by fatigue had unwillingly submitted
to the power of that consoler of human grief, sleep.
Her face was turned towards the window, and the moonlight
illumined her entire figure, which was rendered more
prominent by the fact that the cradle stood in the centre
of the room. She was still attired in the garments she
had borrowed, and her brown hair, fell in two long braids
over her loose white sleeves, from whence they dropped
upon the face of the sleeping child, while Magde's elbow
was resting upon the little pillow.</p>

<p>"What a picture for a painter!" thought Gottlieb.
"Young Lonner is not the most miserable of men, by my
faith; but I know one who at some future time will look
much prettier in that position!"</p>

<p>The dull sound of a horse's hoofs, aroused him from his
reveries.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha," thought he as a smile of triumph played upon
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>his lips, "I was right. We shall now see what is to happen."</p>

<p>Gottlieb returned to his hiding place in the hedge with
noiseless rapidity. He had not remained long in his somewhat
tiresome position, when the sound of the horse's
hoofs ceased, and from the noise which proceeded from
the other side of the hedge he concluded that the owner
of the horse had dismounted and was securing his animal
to a tree.</p>

<p>He soon heard the sound of light footsteps proceeding
over the grass, and then he discovered the familiar form
of Mr. Fabian approaching the cottage. After the new
comer had assured himself that the door was fastened he
advanced to the window near which Gottlieb had been
standing a moment before. Instead of spending time in useless
watchfulness he immediately tapped upon the window;
but Magde slept so soundly that the noise did not disturb
her.</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian flatted his nose against the window pane
and suddenly discovered the picture that Gottlieb had so
much admired. Yet it was not an expression of love
which passed his lips as he gazed upon her.</p>

<p>"Confound that woman!" he exclaimed, "she drives
me mad, and I believe she would look on, if I was parching
with thirst in the torments of hell, and not give me a
single drop of water."</p>

<p>He again tapped upon the pane so loudly, that a person
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>less fatigued than Magde would have awakened. At
this moment Mr. Fabian was struck with fear at his own
temerity.</p>

<p>"Only think," thought he, "suppose I should awaken
some one else! What if an account of this should come
to my wife's ear!"&mdash;the thought was terrible, and the
guilty husband's knees trembled violently. So much
did he respect his "dear Ulgenie," that he felt it even at
his present distance from her, and perhaps he would have
relinquished all his plans in relation to his beautiful Magde,
had he not discovered that the window was fastened only
with a small cord.</p>

<p>To break off a small twig from a neighboring bush, and
to thrust it through the crevice of the window and remove
the cord from the hook, was the work of an instant, and
before Gottlieb could fully understand the nature of his
uncle's movements he saw him suddenly disappear
through the window.</p>

<p>Of course Magde was now awakened by the noise of
Mr. Fabian's abrupt entrance, and she quickly sprang from
the chair. When she recognized the intruder she was
seized with a deathly fear; which was however but of
momentary continuance. With flashing eyes, and
haughtily curling lips she advanced towards him with
a bearing so threatening that Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; retreated in
fear.</p>

<p>"Why do you visit me at this hour?" she inquired.</p>

<p><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>"I was unable to come earlier. I have been to see the
justice and made such arrangements that I think Mr.
Lonner can be released as early as to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And to speak these words&mdash;undoubtedly well intended&mdash;you
have crawled through my window."</p>

<p>"Upon my honor it was not my fault. I knocked several
times, and not wishing to go home without telling
you this good news, which I thought would cause you to
sleep better&mdash;and observing you had not retired&mdash;I seized
the only opportunity remaining."</p>

<p>"Well," replied she, "I do not think harm will result
from your friendly visit, but as it is out of the order of
things that you should remain here, I must request you to
leave the room in the manner you entered, and then I can
converse with you through the window."</p>

<p>"Cruel Magde!" exclaimed Mr. Fabian entreatingly, and
even dared to extend his hand towards her. But Magde
repulsed him with a look of scorn and anger.</p>

<p>"Travel no further upon this crooked path, and call me
Magde no longer, I bear the name of my husband, and
wish to be called by that title alone."</p>

<p>Gottlieb who could observe and overhear all that occurred,
or was said in Magde's chamber, could scarcely
refrain from laughter as he saw his good uncle retreating
before the virtuous woman until he arrived at the window
from which he somewhat clumsily descended. Gottlieb
was on the point of rushing forward to receive his loved relative
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>in his arms and thus preventing him from injuring his
precious limbs, when the sound of Magde's voice prevented
him from rendering this important service to his uncle.</p>

<p>"There, that will do," said she, "we can now converse
without inconvenience to either of us. I hope Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; has
not hurt himself."</p>

<p>"O, never mind me," replied he, "your heart is too
hard to be moved at my sufferings."</p>

<p>"I wish to say a word to you, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;. Your labor
is entirely thrown away upon me. I can pity the
folly of a man if his folly is not evil; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Am I evil? Try me," interrupted Mr. Fabian hastily.</p>

<p>"I will," replied Magde. "If you will bind yourself to
release my father I shall ever be grateful for the service."</p>

<p>"And nothing further?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Then, at least give me your hand that I may with it
wipe away the tears that scald my eyes. I am a weak,
a tender hearted man, and must weep when I am scoffed
at. But never mind, give me your hand, a moment."</p>

<p>"It is impossible."</p>

<p>"Give me but your little finger."</p>

<p>In lieu of a reply, Magde endeavored to close the window;
but her admirer prevented her from doing so.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed he furious at his defeat. "You wish
to enjoy a boon, and not reward the donor. Then listen,
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>the old man shall remain where he is. If I do not interest
myself for him no one else will."</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen. Mr. Gottlieb has returned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! then, he has returned. Well, what can he do?"</p>

<p>"Not much, my dear uncle," exclaimed Gottlieb advancing
towards Mr. Fabian, "except to give my dear
aunt Ulrica, a full account of the interesting conversation I
have accidentally overheard."</p>

<p>"Without replying Mr. Fabian stared a moment in bewildered
surprise, at the intruder, and then rushing wildly
to his horse, he mounted and urged the animal to a furious
speed.</p>

<p>"Well, well," exclaimed Magde, "we can well compare
Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; to a hare. But Mr. Gottlieb, whatever chance
brought you here, do not bring sorrow upon him, by
speaking to his wife of this adventure."</p>

<p>"Fear not, Mrs. Lonner, I have not been on the watch
here to become an informer; but as I heard certain things
from Nanna to-day, and as I from the first have suspected
my uncle, and as I wished to have him in my power&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand you Mr. Gottlieb. You are an honest
and faithful friend, and we shall never forget&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I, Mrs. Lonner," interrupted Gottlieb, "I shall
not forget this valley I assure you, and now good night;
in a short time everything will be as it was before."</p>

<p><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>"Thank you, a thousand times! When Ragnar returns,
through God's assistance we will repay you."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Gottlieb's heart bounded with joy, as he proceeded on
his road towards Almvik, but the heart of another traveller
in the same direction was oppressed with gloomy forebodings.
It is almost unnecessary to say that the latter
traveller was Mr. Fabian H&mdash;&mdash;. On his arrival at Almvik
he entered his wife's chamber trembling with anxiety,
lest Gottlieb had been there before him.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you?" inquired his wife, who
had already retired to her bed; "has the horse been
balky, or have you met with an accident?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing, darling Ulgenie; but my head has
been heavy all the afternoon."</p>

<p>"That is caused by your excessive sleeping," said Mrs.
Ulrica.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is. Hereafter I shall sleep less, and after
this, my dear wife, I will follow your advice in everything."</p>

<p>"Then, my dear, you will be a good husband. If I
should always find you so, I would not have so many
causes for complaint."</p>

<p><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>"Have you any complaint to make now?" inquired Mr.
Fabian, anxiously.</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian was in a state of fearful suspense. The air
to him appeared populated with evil spirits.</p>

<p>"I did not speak thus for the purpose of troubling you,
dear Fabian, it would not be just for me to choose this
moment, when you feel so repentant, to remind you of
other moments when you do not seem impressed with the
worth of your wife."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that would indeed be cruel, for it is true,
really true, that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, Fabian, good Fabian?"</p>

<p>"That I never before have so much esteemed and
adored you, my dear, dear&mdash;" He was unable to
proceed.</p>

<p>"Ah! Fabian, that is the true spirit. You at last
understand how happy you are."</p>

<p>"Yes, as happy as the condemned sinner," sighed
Fabian; but in such a manner that his wife heard the first
word only.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Festival.</span></h3>


<p>The next morning, when Gottlieb awoke, he discovered
that he had a visitor even at that early hour of the day.
His uncle Fabian was pacing backward and forward at
the side of his nephew's bed, with a countenance so
wretched and woe begone, that Gottlieb could not but pity
him.</p>

<p>"Good morning, uncle," said Gottlieb, cheerfully, "how
is your health?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Your voice sounds just as if I was a robber demanding
your purse or your life. What is the matter?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>"That which you told me yesterday makes your comparison
very apt."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken. It is not my intention to play the
part of the famous Rinaldo Rinaldini. I am the most
peaceable person in the world, and if you wish to remain
at peace at home&mdash;which is very natural, you know&mdash;I
have no desire to prevent you from doing so."</p>

<p>"But, perhaps, you intend to demand from me three
times the sum of money necessary to fee a lawyer, to bribe
you to secrecy."</p>

<p>"Shame upon you. I have not demanded anything. I
only expect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" inquired his uncle.</p>

<p>"That you will of your own free will and accord loan
me the money necessary to pay old Mr. Lonner's fine. In
a few months, when Ragnar Lonner returns and repays
me, I will settle with you. If he does not repay me, why
it is but a small sum to lose."</p>

<p>"And what will you require for yourself?" inquired
Mr. Fabian.</p>

<p>"Shall I peddle out my secret like a Jew? I swear by
my honor that I will not divulge to my aunt one word of
all that has passed."</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian thrust his hand into his capacious pocket,
and withdrawing his purse, with a sigh counted the money
into Gottlieb's hand.</p>

<p><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>"I shall not give you my note for this, for if I am not
repaid I do not expect to repay you."</p>

<p>His uncle did not immediately reply, but after opening
and closing his purse several times, he addressed his
nephew in a tone which displayed deep and true emotion.</p>

<p>"Gottlieb," said he, "I am not miserly. You have
spared me when you might have prepared a place of torment
for me. I am grateful. Have you any debts? Your
father is not rich."</p>

<p>"That is spoken like a man of honor and a true relation,"
said Gottlieb, warmly, "but fortunately I have
always been obliged to live economically, and therefore
have escaped from falling into the foolish habit of contracting
debts."</p>

<p>"Well, then, if you have no debts, you at least have a
future to prepare for. You must not therefore refuse my
offer."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to make use of it at present. Yet I do
not wish you to consider it refused entirely. At this moment
I do not require anything, unless indeed you wish to
spare my feet and my boots, by giving me a little money to
pay my travelling expenses. When the time comes, and
I find myself fully engaged in my father's office, I will
consider your proposal with the greatest pleasure."</p>

<p>"Do so, and I will have a good memory, I assure
you."</p>

<p>"One word more, uncle. You must promise me to
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>trouble the worthy Mrs. Lonner no longer. She will never
submit to your desires."</p>

<p>As he thus spoke, an ashy paleness o'erspread Mr. Fabian's
countenance, and with a shudder he glanced fearfully
around the room.</p>

<p>"O, the walls have no ears," said Gottlieb; "but uncle
you will promise me this, will you not."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly," replied his uncle. "That woman has
driven me almost mad; but I think that last night's fright
has entirely cured me. I shall not go there again under
any circumstances."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The songs of the birds of the valley were more melodious
than ever before, the perfume of the roses and lilacs
were sweeter than formerly, at least so thought the occupants
of the little cottage when Gottlieb visited them that
afternoon. Certainly, however, the feast which was given
on that day had never been equalled before, except perhaps
on the day of the arrival of Ragnar after a long
absence from his wife and home.</p>

<p>It was a splendid dinner&mdash;roasted spare ribs, and fish,
and cakes. The old man occupied the seat at the head of
the table. Gottlieb, who had provided this repast from
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>the money he had received from his uncle for travelling
expenses, was seated beside Nanna. The children ate so
rapidly and heartily that it appeared as though they intended
to swallow a sufficient supply to last them for a
year to come. Carl, wearing his Sunday vest, a vest that
Magde had made, and with a rose in his jacket button-hole,
a rose that Magde had plucked, was seated in his usual
place at the table, cheerful and contented. Magde attended
almost solely to the old man's wants, filling his
plate, and replenishing his cup. And lastly, little Christine,
who trotted from place to place, taking care of the
cow, dog, sheep, goats, and the ancient cat, was as happy
and cheerful as the others. Altogether the scene was beautiful
and harmonious.</p>

<p>"And for all this happiness," said the old man, looking
tearfully upon the youth, "for all this happiness, Mr. Gottlieb,
next to God, we are indebted to you. Happy must
be the parents of such a son!"</p>

<p>"Father Lonner," said Gottlieb glancing around the table,
with a friendly smile, "you have no reason to be envious."</p>

<p>"That is true," replied the old man nodding his head
pleasantly to the circle of beloved ones.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, after the old man had retired to his
comfortable bed, now doubly comfortable to him, to rest
himself awhile, and Magde was seated by his bedside pleasantly
chatting with him, while Carl was busy making little
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>boats for the children, Nanna and Gottlieb were seated
near the spring beneath the tree, in the meadow.</p>

<p>It could easily be believed that the young couple were
not very talkative, for Nanna was busily engaged in searching
in the grass for a four leaved clover, and Gottlieb was
amusing himself, according to his childish custom, by blowing
shrill blasts upon a thick blade of grass.</p>

<p>It was sunset. The glowing reflection of the sun fell
upon Nanna's pale neck and face, illumining them with a
golden blush.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Gottlieb, at length, throwing aside
the blade of grass, and assuming a serious cast of countenance,
"I am sorry that our lessons must have an end;
but all is for the best, for, my child, you know enough
already."</p>

<p>"More than enough," replied Nanna, softly.</p>

<p>"Especially for a school teacher," said Gottlieb.</p>

<p>"Yes, especially for a school teacher," repeated Nanna.</p>

<p>"But you speak so abstractedly. You are not so lively
as usual."</p>

<p>"I did not know it; but if Gottlieb says so, it must be
true. When one has been so glad as I have been to-day,
and then as sorrowful, it takes much courage to meet the
change indifferently."</p>

<p>"But, dear Nanna, you were aware that I should be
forced to go away soon."</p>

<p><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>"I did not know that you were going so soon as to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"Neither did I, myself, when I saw you yesterday; but
when I determined to go by the steamboat, you perceive
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"And then again what difference will a day or two more
or less make, when we part&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never again to meet," interrupted Nanna.</p>

<p>"You will do right in the meantime not to hope too
much."</p>

<p>Nanna glanced inquiringly towards Gottlieb.</p>

<p>"Do you not think it strange, Nanna, that we who have
been acquainted but so short a season, should think so
much of each other?"</p>

<p>"It is perfectly natural that we should. Persons in
fashionable society cannot become so well acquainted with
each other as we could in one hour. At first we met each
other every evening, then every morning and evening, and
at length&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And at length morning, noon and night!" interrupted
Gottlieb, with a smile. "In truth, Nanna, you are right,
for if our every meeting was so divided that we should be
together but once each week, our acquaintance would
have been prolonged for an entire year."</p>

<p>"O, much longer than that even," said Nanna, joining
in Gottlieb's laugh.</p>

<p><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>"And as we have remained by our agreement not to
fall in love with each other, we part as friends, and not in
despair, and what is still better, not with reproaches,
which, had the case been different, we would have been
obliged to make and listen to."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is fortunate, very fortunate, that&mdash;that&mdash;"
stammered Nanna, unable to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>"We need not conceal from ourselves that in making
that arrangement we ran a great risk. For my part, I am
not too proud to say that it has been very difficult for me
to keep it."</p>

<p>"But Gottlieb," replied Nanna, "as you have kept it,
it is better as it is."</p>

<p>"Certainly; but then it is not so good as I wish to
have it."</p>

<p>"How do you wish it to be then?" inquired Nanna
innocently.</p>

<p>"Upon my honor I can hardly say; but if I was placed
in better circumstances&mdash;" Nanna dropped her eyelids
over their soft tell-tale orbits; but not so quickly but that
Gottlieb detected a ray of hope gleaming from their deep
wells.</p>

<p>"Will you advise me what course to take, when I have
obtained a competency?" continued Gottlieb.</p>

<p>"No, that would be of no use; but Mr. Gottlieb, when
I hear that you have wedded the rich wife of whom you
have spoken, I will rejoice at your good fortune."</p>

<p><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>"And does not the thought of that rich wife cost you
even half a sigh?"</p>

<p>"Not if that wife will render you happy."</p>

<p>"Nanna, you speak as though you did not love me
at all!" exclaimed Gottlieb hastily, forgetting entirely the
part he had determined to play during this interview.</p>

<p>"And should I love you?" inquired Nanna blushing
deeply. "I think I am not such a foolish girl as that."</p>

<p>"But I believe that you love me," replied Gottlieb.
"Can you deny that your heart is mine?"</p>

<p>"I do not deny it; but I shall not allow it to be so,"
said Nanna with a glance that immediately cooled Gottlieb's
sudden ardor. "My heart is my own, and should
not be an object of trouble to you; and I assure you Mr.
Gottlieb that I shall not allow any weakness on my part
to cause you to break the judicious contract we have
made."</p>

<p>"Ah! Nanna, you are both wise and charitable. I
shall not endeavor to wrest the secret from you; but you
are so much esteemed by me, that at some future day,
when I can follow my own inclinations I will return to
you."</p>

<p>"I will forget these last words, Mr. Gottlieb, for I
think them the saddest you have ever uttered."</p>

<p>"You are right; but I spoke as I thought. It is not
my fault if I thought that you were above all others most
suitable to become my wife."</p>

<p><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>As he thus spoke Nanna trembled violently and she
looked upon him with a gaze which contained more bitterness
than words could have expressed.</p>

<p>"I believe I am mad indeed. I have endeavored to
speak in a better spirit, and instead of so doing&mdash;I had
better go immediately&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or what?"</p>

<p>"Or I will, yes, I will, hold you to my heart, and swear
to you, as true as I am an honest man, that I love you,
and you alone, come what may, I can withhold myself no
longer." Gottlieb suited the action to the word, and
enfolded the blushing girl in his warm embrace.</p>

<p>"O, Gottlieb!" cried Nanna, weeping and laughing,
"this is madness indeed!"</p>

<p>"No, on the contrary it is happiness!"</p>

<p>"But to-morrow you will repent it!"</p>

<p>"Never, Nanna, I sincerely believe that all is for the
best. We can work hard; we have only a few needs, and
it is such happiness to love each other."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must accustom yourself to omit that disagreeable
word. When my mind is once made up, I permit of no
<i>ifs</i> nor <i>buts</i>. And as we do not require a great amount
of money to defray our little domestic expenses, I think
it would be wrong for us to waste the best part of our
lives in useless delay. After one year has elapsed, the
parson shall unite us as man and wife, and I shall take
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>you from this valley, and we will look forward to all the
joys and sorrows, which our Heavenly Father in his wisdom
shall send us."</p>

<p>Nanna, who for a long season had battled against the
intoxicating desire which had filled her heart, gradually
assented to Gottlieb's words, and the interview terminated
with a second agreement, which was directly contrary to
the first one, for by it they bound themselves to love each
other forever.</p>

<p>They agreed that this change from their former agreement
should be concealed from all others. They alone
should know the secret.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ragnar.</span></h3>


<p>Autumn arrived.</p>

<p>The valley was strewn with yellow leaves. The birds
had ceased their songs. The grass had withered. Rains
and storms had discolored the fountain. Yet, although
Nature seemed to have been engaged in contentious strife,
still joy reigned supreme within the little cottage. Ragnar,
the beloved husband, the darling son, had returned.
Seated in the midst of his children beside his lovely wife,
and with his arm encircling her waist, he listened with a
countenance changing from cheerfulness to solemnity to a
recital of all that had transpired during his absence.</p>

<p><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>As soon as Mr. Lonner, for he was the narrator, had
concluded, Ragnar advanced and enfolded the old man in
his arms.</p>

<p>"What viper did this? I have a strong suspicion&mdash;to
cast such an old man into prison&mdash;and I was away
from you, unable to protect you and these weak and
deserted women."</p>

<p>As he thus spoke, his countenance glowed with indignation.</p>

<p>A slight cough at the other side of the room attracted
Ragnar's attention. It was Carl.</p>

<p>"I understand you, Carl," said he, "you must pardon
me. I forgot myself when I said the women were deserted."</p>

<p>And the frank and honest Ragnar, whose ruddy brown
countenance bespoke his health, advanced and extended
his hand to Carl, who with a face as sickly and yellow as
the seared leaves without, was reclining upon the sofa,
watching the family group with a restless eye.</p>

<p>Poor Carl, each day he gradually faded, and his belief
in the warning voice he had heard in the church yard became
firm and unwavering. He accepted Ragnar's proffered
hand with a grateful smile.</p>

<p>"How hot you are!" exclaimed Ragnar, "I will hasten
to the village and speak to the physician."</p>

<p>As Ragnar thus spoke, Carl laughed in his peculiar
manner. "That will be profitable indeed!" said he.</p>

<p><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>"Certainly it will, dear Carl," said Magde, approaching
the sick youth, "Ragnar is right."</p>

<p>"Ragnar is always right," said Carl, in an unusually
sharp tone, "so long as you please him you do not care if
you neglect my wishes."</p>

<p>"What, Carl, do you not love your brother?" said Ragnar,
in a tone of reproach, at the same time pressing a
kiss unobserved, as he thought, upon his wife's lips. Ragnar
always felt an inclination to conceal from the observation
of others the fact that he still loved his wife as he had
when he first wedded her, and therefore rarely caressed
her when in the presence of witnesses; but on this occasion,
his affection was so great that he could not resist the
pleasure of stealing a kiss.</p>

<p>"Is not the entire room large enough for you to kiss in
without my seeing you?" said Carl, harshly, "I do not
wish you to do so right before me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you envy me," said Ragnar, with a laugh.
He had not given Carl's expression a serious thought.</p>

<p>Carl lifted himself upon his elbow, and gazing full in
his brother's eyes, he replied slowly and firmly, "Yes."</p>

<p>"Why do you, Carl?" inquired Ragnar.</p>

<p>"Because I do not wish any body to kiss Magde&mdash;is it
not so, Magde? You well know how I behaved myself
when Mr. Fabian H&mdash;&mdash; wanted to buy a kiss of you."</p>

<p>"What! I believe the poor boy is mad! What! Buy
a kiss of Magde! Poor Carl!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>"Am I speaking false, Magde? Answer me."</p>

<p>"O, Carl, how strangely you tell your story!" exclaimed
Magde, "you ought first to have related how it happened,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Magde flushed and paled alternately, and in her excitement
could scarcely express herself.</p>

<p>"Can there be any truth in this?" said Ragnar, and his
eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>Magde had now recovered her presence of mind, and
related, without concealing a single fact, all that had happened
between herself and Mr. Fabian.</p>

<p>"I am now firmly convinced that this&mdash;this&mdash;no matter,
that Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; was the prime cause of our father's imprisonment."</p>

<p>"He was," interrupted old Mr. Lonner. "I am as
firmly convinced of it, as I am that the young man of
whom I have spoken was the cause of my release. I wish
you were acquainted with Mr. Gottlieb. He is a worthy
young man."</p>

<p>"I will tell him so in the letter I shall write him; but
what if he entertained the same desire that influenced Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Fear not for me, at least," replied Magde, casting a
roguish look towards Nanna.</p>

<p>"Ah! that is singular indeed; but after all Nanna will
bear a pretty close inspection&mdash;but I cannot drive that Mr.
Fabian from my mind."</p>

<p><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>"First you must tell us some of your adventures," and
Magde's countenance wore such an entreating expression
that her husband understood her immediately; and therefore
as long as he remained in the presence of his father,
and his sister and brother, he continued speaking of all
the singular things he had seen and heard, which was listened
to by a pleased and expectant audience.</p>

<p>At length the time arrived when the husband and wife
were at liberty to interchange their thoughts freely; the
children had been nicely tucked in their little beds, and
Ragnar and Magde alone occupied their private apartment.</p>

<p>"Now, dear Magde, now you must give me a good kiss.
God bless you for this happy moment. After tossing six
months upon the ocean, it is a joy indeed to return to one's
own home and wife."</p>

<p>"Is it true indeed, dear Ragnar, that you love me now
as you did when we were married?"</p>

<p>"Did you find no four-leaved clover last summer, that
you ask me this question?"</p>

<p>Without replying, Magde hastily opened a clothes press,
and produced an old compass box, from which she took a
handful of withered clover leaves.</p>

<p>"See here," said she.</p>

<p>"And do these not convince you?" inquired Ragnar.</p>

<p>In this old box, Magde preserved, so to speak, the
tokens of her wedded joys. From the first year of her
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>marriage, she, whenever her husband was absent, would
seek in the meadow for four-leaved clovers, under the conviction
that so long as she continued to find them, she
might rely upon the continued love and fidelity of her
husband. And she was invariably successful, and each
year she deposited the clover leaves in the old compass
box. As Ragnar uttered his last question, Magde cast
herself upon his breast, and gazed tenderly into his face.</p>

<p>"O don't look at me too closely, to-morrow I will look
better, after I am washed and dressed," said Ragnar, arranging
his shirt bosom, and smoothing down his jacket
collar.</p>

<p>"You are so good already, that if you should be better
it would be dangerous; but Ragnar, you have forgotten
to measure the children to see how much they have grown
since your departure. You used to do that as soon as
you entered the house after a return from a long voyage."</p>

<p>"This time," replied Ragnar, "you greeted me with
such strange news that I quite forgot all my usual habits.
It grieves me to observe that Carl is upon the verge of the
grave. True, he was ill last winter; but he soon recovered."</p>

<p>"He exerted himself too much during our troubles,"
said Magde, "then he has taken no care of himself, and
then&mdash;yes, yes, there is something very strange about
Carl."</p>

<p><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>"What do you mean by strange, Magde?" inquired
her husband. "Do you think that he is really insane?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, I did not mean that; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak on, speak your mind."</p>

<p>"Now, do not laugh at my fancy&mdash;or be vexed with
poor Carl. I think that&mdash;he loves me too much, and his
passion has weighed heavily upon him, although he does
not, himself, understand it."</p>

<p>"Your words are worthy of reflection, Magde; now I
remember, his conduct did appear peculiar when he
said he envied me the privilege of kissing you. Poor
fellow, how could I be vexed with him? He, probably,
never desired to vex either you or myself."</p>

<p>"Never. Frequently during the summer I have placed
flowers in his room, and in them he took his greatest
delight. Even now he loves to hear me sing to him, or
to read a chapter in the Bible, above all other things."</p>

<p>"Such love," said Ragnar, "is a beautiful rose, the perfume
of which cheers a drooping spirit. He may continue
his love; it will sustain him in his last trial. Hereafter,
I will not even take your hand in his presence."</p>

<p>"How kind you are, dear Ragnar. Now I can be to
him as I was before your return." Magde wiped the
tears from her long eyelashes, and before Ragnar could
question her, she continued: "You may depend upon my
fidelity. I only wish to afford him a slight ray of joy
while he is still on earth. Without me he stands alone."</p>

<p><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>"Act your own pleasure, my dear Magde, you are aware
that I confide in you as in my own heart. Although I
shall act gently towards Carl, who with his own desire,
would not injure me, still I will not be so submissive with an
individual like Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, who has conducted himself
most wrongfully."</p>

<p>From these words Magde became aware that she would
be obliged to relate all that had occurred between Mr.
Fabian and herself, and this she did accordingly.</p>

<p>She feared more from Ragnar's silence than she would
if he had given vent to his rage in words. Ragnar possessed
a faculty of controlling his anger by a silence
which was much more impressive than furious speech.</p>

<p>"Ah, then he entered your window, after he had first
removed the old man. Well, well, worse things have
been done before."</p>

<p>This was all he said; and as not only the following, but
also the second day passed, without Mr. Fabian's name
being mentioned, Magde thought that Ragnar had looked
at the affair with sensible eyes. She even felt somewhat
annoyed at the thought that Mr. Fabian's punishment
should be so light.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Hour in Mistress Ulrica's Chamber.</span></h3>


<p>Throughout the entire fall, Mr. Fabian had been his
"sweet Ulgenie's" humblest slave, and therefore had been
trod deeper into the dust. Since he had learned of the
return of Ragnar Lonner, he had suffered a feverish anxiety.
Even his easy chair no longer afforded him rest, for
sleeping or waking, one object alone was constantly before
his eyes: Ragnar Lonner's wrathful countenance peering
through the door.</p>

<p>He was suddenly seized with as strong a desire for
active life, as he formerly possessed for easy rest, and he
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>felt himself in no safety except when at a distance from
the mansion, for he knew that Ragnar possessed too much
honor to entrap him in an ambuscade.</p>

<p>One morning, when he, as had been his custom for the
previous week, went to his wife with the information that
he was compelled to take a short journey, she sharply
accosted him:</p>

<p>"Man, what does all this restlessness mean? Are you
insane? Am I always to be left at home alone?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear," replied Mr. Fabian, "you are aware
that I must attend to my business."</p>

<p>"I know that not long since you found it difficult to take
care of yourself. This sudden change in your disposition
will never do."</p>

<p>"Dear Ulgenie, I acknowledge your superior judgment;
but to-day I really must attend the auction at Rorby,
there is to be a sale of some genuine Spanish sheep."</p>

<p>"Ah! as that is really some business, you may go; but
come home early."</p>

<p>"I hope to return before eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ulrica presented him her hand to kiss, and after he
had pressed it to his lips with all the gallantry which was
still left him, he quickly turned away from her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ulrica during the entire day was filled with wonder
at the sudden change that had taken place in her husband,
and if she could have for a moment entertained such
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>a thought, she would have believed that her husband had
become acquainted with some intriguing female.</p>

<p>But among her female acquaintances in the neighborhood,
there was not one whom Fabian had not seen at
least twenty times, and he had undergone each new ordeal
with a firmness which proved that he was out of all
danger.</p>

<p>This point once settled, Mistress Ulrica was more composed,
and after having spent the day in attending to her
domestic duties, she retired to her bed at an early hour,
for she always felt weary and ill-humored when her Fabian,
whom she really loved, was not at home to hear her tender
words and reproaches.</p>

<p>About an hour had elapsed after Mrs. Ulrica had fallen
asleep. The servant also slept soundly, for, although she
had been told to wait for her master, she had satisfied her
conscience by leaving the hall door unlocked&mdash;contrary
to her mistress' strict command&mdash;and then retired to her
bed.</p>

<p>As before said, Mrs. Ulrica had been asleep about an
hour, when she was disturbed by a singular noise which
resembled the shuffling of feet near the bed. She opened
one eye that she might warn her husband that one of his
first duties should be not to disturb his wife's slumbers.
But the warning produced no effect. This being the case,
Mistress Ulrica found it necessary to open the other eye,
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>that by the aid of the night light she might discover Fabian's
true condition.</p>

<p>She first glanced towards the sofa; it was empty. Then
she looked towards the easy chair; but as this stood partially
in the shadow of the large bed curtains, she was able
only to perceive a pair of feet, and it was these very feet
that had the impertinence to shuffle in her room, without
asking her permission.</p>

<p>"Fabian," she exclaimed, "are you not ashamed of
yourself? What are you doing?"</p>

<p>But Fabian did not reply.</p>

<p>"Ah, you foolish man, I see now that you have been
made drunk, you could not withstand their entreaties, poor
man; please prepare for bed."</p>

<p>And yet no answer.</p>

<p>"He is as drunk as possible. Go to your own room,
Fabian; be careful, do not take a light with you, and do
not fall down stairs and hurt yourself. Are you going to
move to-night? Shall I ring the bell for the servants, that
they may carry you to bed?"</p>

<p>Not receiving a reply, Mrs. Ulrica tore aside the bed
curtains, and extending her hand, placed it upon a strange
head of hair.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" she exclaimed, "that is not my husband!"</p>

<p>"What of that, it is the husband of another," replied a
calm voice.</p>

<p><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>Terror prevented Mrs. Ulrica from crying aloud. "A
thief!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"I do not think so," replied the voice.</p>

<p>"Who are you then?" stammered she.</p>

<p>"Sleep quietly, you shall not be disturbed."</p>

<p>Mistress Ulrica continued to feel for the bell cord. "I
believe," said she, "he wishes to murder me when I am
asleep."</p>

<p>"Sleep quietly, I neither wish to steal nor to murder. I
only wish to&mdash;"</p>

<p>The unfortunate cramp, which at her first terror had attacked
Mrs. Ulrica's throat, now suddenly disappeared,
and she emitted a long and loud scream; but no sooner
had this been accomplished, than a large brawny hand
was placed roughly over her mouth.</p>

<p>"Please do that no more," said the voice, "or I shall be
forced to be troublesome, and do not look for the bell-rope,
it would only be disagreeable for you if the servants
should enter the room now."</p>

<p>"What do you want then, fearful man?"</p>

<p>"To remain where I am. At present I want nothing
further."</p>

<p>Suddenly a new light dawned in Mrs. Ulrica's brain.
What if he should be an unfortunate suitor for her love.</p>

<p>"How?" said she, forcing all her pride and dignity
into her words, "how? remain here? Sir, this is my bed-room."</p>

<p><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>"I am aware of the fact."</p>

<p>"And here no man has a right to enter except my husband."</p>

<p>"And myself," added the voice.</p>

<p>At this unexpected reply, the lady summoned courage
to examine the unabashed visitor more closely. He was
an elegantly formed man, and as he gazed at her with his
expressive eyes, interest and repugnance were both created
within her heart. The repugnance was caused by the fact
that the man wore a blue frieze coat, which unfortunate
garment at once dispelled her romantic dreams.</p>

<p>"Will you explain the cause of this unheard of impertinence?"</p>

<p>"That cause will very soon arrive."</p>

<p>"Very soon? You did not seek me then?"</p>

<p>"Not precisely."</p>

<p>"Then probably you wish to see my husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Am I at all concerned, then?"</p>

<p>"Slightly."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Mrs. Ulrica, who now remembered
her strange visitor's first observation, "there must be a
mystery about this which I do not understand. You remarked
that you were the husband of another."</p>

<p>"True."</p>

<p>"And furthermore you said you had a right to seek my
husband in this room?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>"You certainly know your alphabet."</p>

<p>"Then you have&mdash;O, what will become of us!&mdash;you
have&mdash;a demand to make of my husband."</p>

<p>"No, he has a claim on me, and this I will pay back,
principal and interest."</p>

<p>"O, the monster! The crocodile! He has been untrue
to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, both in heart and desire; but my wife is not one
who cries out, or attempts to pull the bell-rope. She commands
respect without so much trouble."</p>

<p>"And do I not, also?"</p>

<p>"I do not know what you would do, if you should see
a man, at this time of night, crawl through your window,
and attempt to bring you to disgrace by the promise that
he would release an old father from prison; but I do know
you have nothing to fear at present."</p>

<p>"You are then Mr. Ragnar Lonner?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"And for such a miserable reward&mdash;that woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! Miserable reward!&mdash;that woman!&mdash;Well,
that night lamp is not very brilliant, but I can easily perceive
that I have before me an old dutch galleon, so badly
rigged and managed, that I would prefer to crowd sail
and make my escape rather than to take her in tow. And
you call my wife that woman! Miserable reward!"</p>

<p>"I do not understand your gibberish, my good man: but
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>that you are unrefined and uneducated I can easily see,
and I command you to quit my room immediately."</p>

<p>"You would then force me to retreat, as my Magde
drove back your husband. Please try the experiment."</p>

<p>"Monster! Unfeeling wretch!" exclaimed she, "is
this the manner to speak to a lady, to an injured wife who
is obliged to bemoan the infidelity of her husband. O,
the villain! I will overpower him with my wrath!"</p>

<p>"My turn comes first," interrupted Ragnar.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha, I understand. My cup is filled to the brim&mdash;blood
must flow&mdash;Lonner do you wish to kill my husband,
then?"</p>

<p>"To fight with him. God forbid. Such things I leave
to people of rank. I have another method of doing my
business."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"O, it is very simple. I thought that nothing would
be more unpleasant to him than to be placed in a disgraceful
position before his wife, and perhaps a greater punishment
for such a miserable man could not be devised than
to&mdash;but no matter, your husband knows why he leaves
his house every day."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ulrica clapped her hands together violently.
Now the riddle was solved. She now knew the cause of
the sudden change in her husband's conduct.</p>

<p>"And, as it has been impossible to find him at home in
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>the daytime," continued Ragnar, "I have come this evening
to settle with him in this place, and at this hour."</p>

<p>Ragnar had scarcely ceased speaking, when heavy and
slow footsteps were heard ascending the stairs.</p>

<p>Like an infuriated tigress waiting for her prey, Mrs.
Ulrica, enveloped in her crimson shawl, sat up in her bed;
her eyes flashing with rage, and her face flushed to a
redness which outvied the crimson of her shawl. She was
awaiting the approach of her husband.</p>

<p>Ragnar arose, and as silent and unmoved as a statue
awaited the entrance of Mr. Fabian. Ragnar had not
produced a dagger or sword; but he drew forth from
under his loose jacket a cow-hide of the greatest elasticity,
and the best quality.</p>

<p>Without dreaming of the terrible storm that had
gathered, and was about to pour down upon his devoted
head, Mr. Fabian entered the apartment. But the moment
his eyes fell upon the forms of his wife, the doom
pronouncer, and Lonner the genius of revenge, he staggered
back towards the door, and had not his legs refused
their office he would have sought safety in flight; but at
two stern glances, one from Lonner, the other from his
wife, he sank powerless to the floor.</p>

<p>And yet, if ever, this was the time for him to assume
the character of Brutus. And what better cause had he
to arouse himself from his stupor, than that Lucretia had
received a male visitor in her bed-chamber. True, Mrs.<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>
Ulrica had not received an insult, neither did she appear
prepared sacrifice herself, like Lucretia, as an atonement
for the outrage. All in all, present appearances were
well calculated to arouse sterner sentiments within Mr.
Fabian's heart; but he was so frightened that he would
have forgiven everything if he could have assured himself
that the horrible spectacle was but a dream which would
vanish at the coming of the morning.</p>

<p>"Perjured traitor!" screamed Mrs. Ulrica, "you hide
yourself like Adam after his fall. But come forth, this
Lucifer will teach you that you no longer dwell in paradise."</p>

<p>"Mr. Lonner," stammered Mr. Fabian, "I am an innocent,
unhappy man, and I swear to you that Mrs. Magde
has never&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he heard these words Ragnar trembled violently.</p>

<p>"Silence, reprobate," said he, "the name of my virtuous
wife shall not pass your lips. She needs none of your
recommendations; but <i>your</i> wife, you pitiful coward, she
shall learn from me, now, what your true character is."</p>

<p>Thus saying Lonner with one hand seized the unlucky
Fabian by the coat-collar, and brandished the horse-whip
over his head with the other.</p>

<p>But as Mr. Fabian made no resistance, but wept and
begged for mercy in loud and wailing tones, Ragnar
released him, and, confused at the singularity of his own
sentiments, he glanced towards Mrs. Ulrica, and said:</p>

<p><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>"He is so cowardly, that it seems almost as bad to
whip him, as it would be to beat a hare. In giving him
over to you I am fully revenged."</p>

<p>The cow-hide disappeared beneath his coat, and Lonner
departed.</p>

<p>But Ragnar Lonner had made a miscalculation, when
he thought that Mr. Fabian would fall into the hands of
the Medusa within the bed-curtains. The very thought
of the humiliation he had undergone, and the fear of what
was yet in store for him, inspired Mr. Fabian with an
unusual degree of courage or rather drove him to
desperation.</p>

<p>Brutus aroused himself. He could see no other method
of escape than by crushing the tigress before she pounced
upon him. He therefore at once attacked her with passionate
actions and wild expressions.</p>

<p>"O, you miserable woman! You faithless wife! Do
you think that I shall allow myself to be blinded by the
farce you have just played with your lover? I will leave
you alone in your house. I cast you from my heart.
The whole world shall know you as I know you now."</p>

<p>"Fabian! Fabian! are you mad?"</p>

<p>Mistress Ulrica was both frightened and pleased. This
was a scene she had long desired.</p>

<p>"If I am mad, who has driven me to madness?"
shouted Mr. Fabian, determined to retain the advantage
he had already won. Then assuming an imposing position
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>he gazed sternly into the face of his trembling wife.
"How long I have closed my eyes to your little indiscretions!
How many bitter tears I have shed, when I
observed how you encouraged that shark who made love
to my wife while he feasted at my table."</p>

<p>Mistress Ulrica, who was suddenly changed from a
tigress into a lamb, assured her husband that she was innocent;
that she had not even entertained a guilty thought.
But as she humbled herself, Mr. Fabian's wrath increased,
and astonished that he had not long before discovered this
method of taming his wife, he played the tyrant <i>con amore</i>.
He accused his wife of so many things, that she, humiliated
and crushed, fell on her knees before him, and entreated
him to restrain his rage until he had ample proofs of her
guilt. This boon Mr. Fabian H&mdash;&mdash; finally condescendingly
granted, and like an indulgent pascha, entreated by
his favorite slave, he at length permitted her to slumber
at his side.</p>

<p>This entire change of government was effected in the
short space of one hour.</p>

<p>The sun was high in the heavens when Mistress Ulrica
awoke. At first she could not distinctly remember the
drama which had been performed the preceding night;
but when all the events were brought clear to her mind,
she sighed deeply. Her destiny was entirely changed; but
after a few moments' reflection, she determined to submit
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>to her fate, and become the one who should obey, not
command.</p>

<p>While she was meditating in what manner she should
refute the charges brought against her by her husband,
she was interrupted by a truly soft and persuasive voice,
which said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sweet Ulgenie, dearest wife, can your heart be
touched? I dreamed last night that I might dare approach
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you have noticed me," said Mrs. Ulrica, immediately
assuming her former authority, when she found
herself thus entreated. "Have you slept out your debauch?"</p>

<p>"Was I&mdash;is it possible that I was inebriated? I have
quite forgotten what happened last night."</p>

<p>"You fool, when were you able to remember anything
unless <i>I</i> reminded you?"</p>

<p>The perusal of a continuance of this scene will scarcely
repay our readers. Suffice it to say that Mr. Fabian's
reign of one hour remained thereafter a legend only. Like
all other unsuccessful revolutions, it was followed by a
government still more exacting and severe.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Carl.</span></h3>


<p>Winter had departed. Ragnar, the bold seaman, had
left his home, and his ship was ploughing the broad ocean.
The grass in the valley waved gracefully in the light winds
of spring. The children once more launched their miniature
boats, and the occupants of the cottage all labored
for the good of the little commonwealth.</p>

<p>But there was one of the family who could not mingle
in their labors, and who sat quietly in his corner, gazing
cheerfully upon the operations of the others. It was
Carl.</p>

<p><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>During the winter Carl had been confined to his bed,
but at the present time he occupied his father's arm-chair,
which the old man had relinquished to him. He usually
sat in a corner near Magde's spinning wheel and his
father's bed-room door.</p>

<p>When the children returned from their out of doors
sports, they would sit on the floor near Carl's chair, and
listen to the many tales of fairies, nymphs, and sea gods,
that he told them in a pleasant but weak voice, while he
as formerly made willow whistles and repaired their little
boats.</p>

<p>The neighbors' children also visited the cottage that
they might hear his last stories, and they all brought with
them many little gifts that their mothers had prepared
for poor Carl. At a later period the mothers came themselves,
bringing their own presents, which they carried in
large baskets, for there was not one in the entire neighborhood
for whom Carl had not performed a service, and
without a solitary exception they all loved him.</p>

<p>Then who was to take his place, after he should be
taken from his friends. In fact perfect pilgrimages were
made to Carl, who always received the pilgrims with pleasant
words and cheerful smiles. Carl was not insensible
to the pleasure he derived from being able in turn to present
to Magde the gifts he received from his friends.</p>

<p>"Ah," Nanna often said, "how pleasant it is to be
beloved," and she would sigh as she thought of the absent
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>one who had vowed to love her forever, and whose word
was her creed of life. How much happiness Nanna
derived from this creed! It solaced her in many lonely
hours, and produced a favorable effect upon her every
action and thought. She no longer was oppressed, as
formerly, with dreaming indolence. Her cheeks were
roses now.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Lonner and Magde were much gratified at this
unexpected change in Nanna's deportment, and they could
account for it only by supposing that she was much wiser
than other girls of her age.</p>

<p>Carl, however, had peculiar views upon this subject, and
when Nanna would exclaim, "O, how pleasant it is to be
beloved!" he would reply:</p>

<p>"You know right well that there is some one who loves
you, or else you would not be so light hearted."</p>

<p>When Carl thus spoke Nanna would blush with confusion.</p>

<p>"You must not speak so when any one can hear you,"
she would reply.</p>

<p>Carl would then nod his head pleasantly, and one day
he learned the secret, for he felt he could not remain long
on this earth, and he wished to know all, and aside from
that Nanna was anxious to discover whether he believed as
firmly as she did in Gottlieb's vows.</p>

<p>"Do you think, Carl," said she, as she concluded her
recital, "do you think he will return?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>"As certainly as I shall never see the sun rise on St.
John's day, for I saw that in his eye, which assured me
he would not break his promises."</p>

<p>"Why do you use such an ominous comparison, Carl?
Why do you think you will not see the sunrise on St.
John's day?"</p>

<p>The pain caused by the beginning of Carl's remark,
clouded the pure joy which his concluding words would
have otherwise created.</p>

<p>"I am waiting," said he, "only that I may see the
lilacs bloom once more. In those beautiful flowers I have
found my greatest joy."</p>

<p>Old Mr. Lonner occasionally attempted to prepare his
son's mind for the future which awaited him; but he
ceased when one day Carl innocently addressed him:</p>

<p>"Father," said he, "I wish you would not talk with me
thus. I believe in our Saviour and his love for us sinners,
and as I do not think I have done much harm&mdash;except
perhaps when I stole the game&mdash;I fear not for the future.
I shall wait patiently until my Saviour chooses to take me
to himself. I can well imagine that there is not much
space in heaven; but I believe that there is a small place
for one so insignificant as me, where I can wait the coming
of Magde, Nanna, Father, Ragnar, and all the little ones,
that is if they do not hold me in contempt."</p>

<p>"How strangely you talk, dear Carl!" said Magde, entering
into the conversation. "You well know that I
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>would like to be near you in heaven, for you are aware
that next to Ragnar I love you more than any other being
on earth."</p>

<p>"You say so only to make me happy; but I am not so
vain as to believe your words."</p>

<p>"Is there any one here who displays more love for you
than I?" inquired Magde.</p>

<p>Carl smiled, and glanced at the wall. There hung a
new vest, the pattern of which Carl examined as carefully
as though each thread had been a painting in itself.</p>

<p>"Do you think," said he, after a pause, during which
his father left the room, "do you think that Ragnar is
vexed with me? He certainly must have observed that I
love you more than, perhaps, I should&mdash;I speak frankly
to you, Magde, for I know you are different from others,
and I could not die in peace if I thought that my brother
Ragnar was offended with me."</p>

<p>"Be convinced, my dear Carl, that Ragnar loves you as
a brother should. He saw undoubtedly that no one could
please you so well as I; but he often told me, and especially
before his last departure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did he say?" inquired Carl, eagerly.</p>

<p>"'Magde,' said he, 'never desert Carl. He is an honest
and faithful soul, who can find no joy unless with you;
but Carl is not the one who would seek to injure me by
word or thought, and therefore I shall not interfere with
his sentiments, but allow him to entertain them freely,
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>and,' he added, 'you may tell him this at some future time
when he may feel troubled on my account.'"</p>

<p>"Did he speak thus, assuredly?"</p>

<p>"He did, I swear it by my hopes of meeting him
again."</p>

<p>"And you have obeyed him, and not deserted me; but
will you do so as long as I am with you here?"</p>

<p>"Never shall I desert you, Carl."</p>

<p>"And when the last moment approaches," said he in a
soft tone, "you will moisten my lips, you will smooth my
pillow, and when the struggle of death comes upon me, I
wish you to hold my hand in yours, as you now do, that I
may feel that you are with me. Then you must&mdash;will you
do so, Magde?&mdash;close my eyes with your own hands, and
sing a psalm to me."</p>

<p>To all these touching requests, which were rendered
still more affecting by the tender expression of his eyes,
Magde replied tearfully:</p>

<p>"My dear Carl, your words shall be obeyed."</p>

<p>Carl smiled. He was now happier at the thought of his
approaching death, which would bring such proofs of
Magde's affection, than one who might have possessed
a prospect of a long and luxurious life.</p>

<p><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>The lilac bushes blossomed, and Magde placed the first
flowers in his hands while he yet could inhale their fragrance.
The last flowers she strewed upon his grave.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span></h3>


<p>A long season of gloom and despondency succeeded the
death of Carl.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that Ragnar returned home at an earlier
period than usually; the flowers on Carl's grave had
not withered when Magde piously conducted him to his
brother's final resting-place.</p>

<p>"Rest in peace, poor brother," said Ragnar, brushing
away a tear, "God saw best to take you from us&mdash;but,
dear Magde, you must not grieve too much for his death,
or you will not be able to rejoice at the news I have for
you."</p>

<p><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>"What news, Ragnar?"</p>

<p>"Captain Hanson, who has been master of the brig
Sarah Christiana ever since I have been her mate, has latterly
become very much reduced in health, and he has concluded
not to go to sea again."</p>

<p>"Well, that cannot be joyful news. He was a better
captain than perhaps you will ever sail under again."</p>

<p>"I shall never sail under another captain. I shall be
captain myself, hereafter. The owners of the vessel have
tendered the captaincy to me."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"It will soon be more than possible, for my old captain
has so well recommended me, that Mr. Lund has advanced
me a sufficient sum of money to pay the charges of my
examination, and as soon as Christmas is over&mdash;for until
then I shall study at home&mdash;I will take a journey to prepare
myself, and after the examination you will be the wife
of a captain. Then you and Nanna can go with me to
Goteborg, that you may see the vessel before I go to sea."</p>

<p>Magde quietly clasped her hands. Her pious gratitude
was evinced in her every expression. She thanked her
God for having thus favored them with fortune.</p>

<p>Ragnar silently embraced her. "I did not say anything
about it yesterday, for I wished to tell you here near
Carl, who always placed his pleasures aside that they might
not interfere with yours."</p>

<p>"Bless you, bless you, Ragnar! I now know why I
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>found so many four leaved clovers last summer&mdash;only
think, a captain's wife!&mdash;and still you love me as before?"</p>

<p>"Now and forever, my Magde. You shall have a bonnet
as magnificent as any other lady; you shall have a
cashmere shawl, and a black silk dress. Yes, I promise you
all this, and more."</p>

<p>"Let us return home quickly, that I may rejoice father
and Nanna."</p>

<p>And Nanna and her father were as much rejoiced at the
glad tidings as was Magde herself.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, Magde and her father were
seated together in the parlor consulting about the future.</p>

<p>"The Lord thus distributes joys and sorrows. One
year ago our prospects were much different."</p>

<p>"Have I forgotten that time? No! And if I should
live a hundred years, I would never forget the day you
were taken from us to prison, nor the day you were released
by Mr. Gottlieb. This year Ragnar must send him
the balance still due him."</p>

<p>"We can repay him the money; but we can never
reward him for his kindness and love. He has not returned
to Almvik, and perhaps it is for the best, and as
Nanna under any circumstance&mdash;"</p>

<p>The old man was suddenly interrupted by a shrill blast
from the outside, which blast was produced by some one
blowing upon a blade of grass.</p>

<p>"Well, well," exclaimed Magde glancing through the
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>window, and then rushing to the door, "the old proverb
is true, 'talk of&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"A certain gentleman and he is here," interrupted
Gottlieb, entering the door with his face beaming with his
usual cheerfulness. He presented one hand to Magde,
and the other to old Mr. Lonner, who exclaimed with glistening
eyes:</p>

<p>"Welcome, welcome, Mr. Gottlieb. Ragnar intended to
write you to-day, and I just told Magde we are able to
discharge one part of our debt, but the other can never be
repaid."</p>

<p>"Enough, enough, good father Lonner, I too was influenced
by a selfish motive&mdash;but pardon me, where is
Nanna?"</p>

<p>"She has gone to fish with Ragnar and little Conrad,"
said Magde, who had already manufactured an urn of
coffee, "but they will soon return."</p>

<p>"Aha! is Mate Lonner at home. Then I can become
acquainted with him."</p>

<p>"<i>Captain</i> Lonner, next spring at least, Mr. Gottlieb,"
said Magde, proudly.</p>

<p>"Crown Secretary, now, instead of Mr. Gottlieb, if you
please, Mrs. Lonner."</p>

<p>"So soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, eight days ago I received the appointment; but
my <i>great</i> fortune will come next spring, for then I hope
to have a little house of my own."</p>

<p><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>"Yes, and perhaps a housekeeper too," added Magde.</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>At this reply Magde cast a secret glance towards her
father, which he returned. Gottlieb, however, changed the
conversation, and commenced speaking of the death of
poor Carl of which he had before been informed. During
the next half hour, Gottlieb evinced the utmost impatience.
He would walk to the window and gaze anxiously
towards the lake, not observing that Magde and her
father were exchanging significant glances and smiles
behind his back.</p>

<p>At length he spied the boat, and he hastened down to
the beach. The skiff contained the brother and sister, and
their little companion.</p>

<p>A sympathetic sentiment seemed to have pervaded the
entire family, for during their excursion Nanna and Ragnar
conversed almost entirely about her young friend Gottlieb.
So nicely had Ragnar probed his sister's heart that
he knew almost as much about its true condition as Carl
had previously learned. Although Ragnar would have
desired to have believed as Carl did, he did not think it
proper to offer Nanna any further consolation, than by
saying that since he had received a captaincy she was placed
on a more equal footing with Gottlieb and that he would
do everything in his power to render her happy.</p>

<p>"I know you will, Ragnar," replied Nanna, "but only
one thing can ever afford me happiness."</p>

<p><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>After these words the conversation ceased, and the brother
and sister commenced their homeward ride.</p>

<p>In his great haste Gottlieb nearly ran into the water, in
which Ragnar was standing fastening the boat; but so
much was he astonished by the marvellous change which
taken place in Nanna's appearance that he was forced
to start back and gaze silently upon her. Nanna in the
meantime appeared abstracted. She had not observed
Gottlieb's approach; but sat in the boat slowly moving one
of the oars, apparently in the deepest thought.</p>

<p>But how can we describe Nanna's joyful surprise when
she discovered Gottlieb. Ragnar's presence prevented
her from giving vent to her joy in words; but the joyful
expression of her eyes was a more than sufficient welcome.</p>

<p>We will not describe the first interview between Ragnar
and Gottlieb&mdash;suffice it to say it was the meeting of
two brothers; not of two strangers. Neither will we
describe the first hour of <i>mutual</i> congratulations; but we
will at once draw the reader's attention to a pleasing picture
near the fountain in the meadow. Here the two
lovers had proceeded that they might confer with each
other uninterrupted.</p>

<p>"You see, my little nymph, I have come back. Do
you think that I have an honorable spirit and a true heart?
Now tell me, have you grown so beautiful, for me; yes
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>so beautiful that I can well be proud of you as my own
little wife?"</p>

<p>"Wife! are you then serious?"</p>

<p>"Serious we shall never be, we will make a third agreement,
which is that we shall live henceforth without a
gloomy thought or serious foreboding. Although we
shall marry, as it is said, for 'love in a cottage,' yet we are
both so familiar with the reality of the cottage, that our
romantic dreams, if we have any, will be fully realized."</p>

<p>"True, very true," said Nanna smiling, and her countenance
radiant with joy, appeared still more beautiful,
"and now I am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;Betrothed," said Gottlieb joyfully embracing her.</p>

<p>How happy were the inmates of the little cottage that
evening!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When the news of Gottlieb's betrothal reached Almvik,
Mrs. Ulrica foretold that nothing but evil would result
from the wedding.</p>

<p>Mr. Fabian, however, who secretly esteemed Gottlieb,
was silent; but afterwards when the young couple were
firmly united he would hold them up as examples and say
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>that some men could be happy with a wife who did not
possess riches and station.</p>

<p>"But that," insisted Mrs. Ulrica, "is no reason why a
poor man should not know to prize the happiness which a
wealthy wife could procure for him."</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
